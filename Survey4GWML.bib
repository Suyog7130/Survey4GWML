  abstract = {The advent of experimental science facilities--instruments and observatories, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope --has brought about challenging, large-scale computational and data processing requirements. Traditionally, the computing infrastructure to support these facility’s requirements were organized into separate infrastructure that supported their high-throughput needs and those that supported their high-performance computing needs. We argue that to enable and accelerate scientific discovery at the scale and sophistication that is now needed, this separation between high-performance computing and high-throughput computing must be bridged and an integrated, unified infrastructure provided. In this paper, we discuss several case studies where such infrastructure has been implemented. These case studies span different science domains, software systems, and application requirements as well as levels of sustainability. A further aim of this paper is to provide a basis to determine the common characteristics and requirements of such infrastructure, as well as to begin a discussion of how best to support the computing requirements of existing and future experimental science facilities.},

Because of the expected low signal to noise ratio of LIGO data and incomplete knowledge of gravitational waveforms, evolutionary computing is an excellent candidate for LIGO data analysis studies. Using the evolutionary computing methods of genetic algorithms and genetic programming, we have developed, as a proof of principle, search algorithms that are effective at finding sine-gaussian signals hidden in noise while maintaining a small false alarm rate. Because we used realistic LIGO noise as a training ground, the algorithms we have evolved should be well suited to detecting signals in actual LIGO data, as well as in simulated noise. These algorithms have continuously improved during the five days of their evolution and are expected to improve further the more they are evolved. The top performing algorithms from generation 100 and 199 were benchmarked using gaussian white noise to illustrate their performance and the improvement over 100 generations.}

These auxiliary channels capture information about the state of the detector and its surroundings which can be used to infer potential terrestrial noise sources of some gravitational-wave-like events. We present an algorithm addressing the ordering (or equivalently optimizing) of such information from auxiliary systems in gravitational-wave detectors to establish veto conditions in searches for gravitational-wave transients. The procedure was used to identify vetoes for searches for unmodeled transients by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations during their science runs from 2005 through 2007. In this work we present the details of the algorithm; we also use a limited amount of data from LIGO's past runs in order to examine the method, compare it with other methods, and identify its potential to characterize the instruments themselves. We examine the dependence of receiver operating characteristic curves on the various parameters of the veto method and the implementation on real data. We find that the method robustly determines important auxiliary channels, ordering them by the apparent strength of their correlations to the gravitational-wave channel. This list can substantially reduce the background of noise events in the gravitational-wave data. In this way it can identify the source of glitches in the detector as well as assist in establishing confidence in the detection of gravitational-wave transients.}

These glitches increase the rate at which random coincidences occur, which reduces the significance of identified gravitational-wave events. The presence of these transients has precipitated extensive work to establish that observed gravitational wave events are astrophysical in nature. We discuss the response of the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from stellar mass binaries to various common glitches that were observed during advanced LIGO’s first and second observing runs. We show how these transients can mimic waveforms from compact binary coalescences and quantify the likelihood that a given class of glitches will create a trigger in the search pipeline. We explore the specific waveform parameters that are most similar to different glitch classes and demonstrate how knowledge of these similarities can be used when evaluating the significance of gravitational-wave candidates.}

Here, we present three new algorithms designed for the automatic classification of noise transients in advanced detectors. Two of these algorithms are based on principal component analysis. They are principal component analysis for transients and an adaptation of LALInference burst.

	abstract = {The data taken by the advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors contains short duration noise transients that limit the significance of astrophysical detections and reduce the duty cycle of the instruments. As the advanced detectors are reaching sensitivity levels that allow for multiple detections of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources it is crucial to achieve a fast and accurate characterization of non-astrophysical transient noise shortly after it occurs in the detectors. Previously we presented three methods for the classification of transient noise sources. They are Principal Component Analysis for Transients (PCAT), Principal Component LALInference Burst (PC-LIB) and Wavelet Detection Filter with Machine Learning (WDF-ML). In this study we carry out the first performance tests of these algorithms on gravitational-wave data from the Advanced LIGO detectors. We use the data taken between the 3rd of June 2015 and the 14th of June 2015 during the 7th engineering run (ER7), and outline the improvements made to increase the performance and lower the latency of the algorithms on real data. This work provides an important test for understanding the performance of these methods on real, non stationary data in preparation for the second advanced gravitational-wave detector observation run, planned for later this year. We show that all methods can classify transients in non stationary data with a high level of accuracy and show the benefits of using multiple classifiers.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing run.}

	abstract = {We present a new method for the classification of transient noise signals (or glitches) in advanced gravitational-wave interferometers. The method uses learned dictionaries (a supervised machine learning algorithm) for signal denoising, and untrained dictionaries for the final sparse reconstruction and classification. We use a data set of 3000 simulated glitches of three different waveform morphologies, comprising 1000 glitches per morphology. These data are embedded in non-white Gaussian noise to simulate the background noise of advanced LIGO in its broadband configuration. Our classification method yields a 96% accuracy for a large range of initial parameters, showing that learned dictionaries are an interesting approach for glitch classification. This work constitutes a preliminary step before assessing the performance of dictionary-learning methods with actual detector glitches.}

  abstract = "The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser-interferometric detectors requires sensitivity to changes in distance much smaller than the diameter of atomic nuclei. Though sophisticated machinery and techniques have been developed over the past few decades to isolate such instruments from non-astrophysical noise, the detectors are still susceptible to instrumental and environmental noise transients known as “glitches,” which hinder searches for transient gravitational waves. The Gravity Spy project is an effort to comprehensively classify the glitches that afflict gravitational wave detectors into morphological families by combining the strengths of machine learning algorithms and citizen scientists. This paper presents the initial Gravity Spy dataset used for citizen scientist and machine learning classification – a static, accessible, documented dataset for testing machine learning supervised classification. Previous versions of this dataset used in [8, 53] did not include all current classes and also for some of the classes, some samples were pruned and added. This set consists of time–frequency images of LIGO glitches and their associated metadata. These glitches are organized by time–frequency morphology into 22 classes for which descriptions and representative images are presented. Results from the application of state-of-the-art supervised classification methods to this dataset are presented in order to provide baselines for future glitch classification work. Standard splitting for training, validation, and testing sets are also presented to facilitate the comparison between different machine learning methods. The baseline methods are selected from both traditional and more recent deep learning approaches. An ensemble framework is developed that demonstrates that combining various classifiers can yield a more accurate model for classification. The ensemble classifier, trained with the standard training set, achieves 98.21% accuracy on the standard test set."

	abstract = {The knowledge of the noise power spectral density of an
interferometric detector of gravitational waves is
fundamental for detection algorithms and for the analysis of
the data. In this paper we address both the problem of
identifying the noise power spectral density of
interferometric detectors by parametric techniques and the
problem of the whitening procedure of the sequence of data.
We will concentrate the study on a power spectral density
like that of the Italian-French detector VIRGO and we show
that with a reasonable number of parameters we succeed in
modelling a spectrum like the theoretical one of VIRGO,
reproducing all of its features.


We also
propose the use of adaptive techniques to identify and to
whiten the data of interferometric detectors on-line. We
analyse the behaviour of the adaptive techniques in the field
of stochastic gradient and in the least-squares filters. As a
result, we find that the least-squares lattice filter is the
best among those we have analysed. It succeeds
optimally in
following all the peaks of the noise power spectrum, and one
of its outputs is the whitened part of the spectrum. Besides,
the fast convergence of this algorithm, it lets us follow the
slow non-stationarity of the noise. These procedures could be
used to whiten the overall power spectrum or only some region
of it. The advantage of the techniques we propose is that they
do not require a priori knowledge of the noise power
spectrum to be analysed. Moreover, the adaptive techniques
let us identify and remove the spectral line, without
building any physical model of the source that produced
it.}

Understanding the statistical properties of noise is a complex endeavor, particularly in realistic detection scenarios. In this article we demonstrate that deep learning can handle the non-Gaussian and non-stationary nature of gravitational wave data, and showcase its application to denoise the gravitational wave signals generated by the binary black hole mergers GW150914, GW170104, GW170608 and GW170814 from advanced LIGO noise. To exhibit the accuracy of this methodology, we compute the overlap between the time-series signals produced by our denoising algorithm, and the numerical relativity templates that are expected to describe these gravitational wave sources, finding overlaps O≳0.99. We also show that our deep learning algorithm is capable of removing noise anomalies from numerical relativity signals that we inject in real advanced LIGO data. We discuss the implications of these results for the characterization of gravitational wave signals."

Various regression and interpolation techniques have been employed to build efficient waveform models, but no study has systematically compared the performance of these methods yet. Here we provide such a comparison. For analytical binary-black-hole waveforms, assuming either aligned or precessing spins, we compare the accuracy as well as the computational speed of a variety of regression methods, ranging from traditional interpolation to machine-learning techniques. We find that most methods are reasonably accurate, but efficiency considerations favour in many cases the simpler approaches. We conclude that sophisticated regression methods are not necessarily needed in standard gravitational-wave modeling applications, although machine-learning techniques might be more suitable for problems with higher complexity than what is tested here.}

To further enhance the science reach of this emergent field, there is a pressing need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that have enabled these groundbreaking discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we introduce Deep Filtering, a new highly scalable method for end-to-end time-series signal processing, based on a system of two deep convolutional neural networks, which we designed for classification and regression to rapidly detect and estimate parameters of signals in highly noisy time-series data streams. We demonstrate a novel training scheme with gradually increasing noise levels, and a transfer learning procedure between the two networks. We showcase the application of this method for the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Our results indicate that Deep Filtering significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster thus allowing real-time processing of raw big data with minimal resources. More importantly, Deep Filtering extends the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This framework leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and emerging hardware architectures, such as deep-learning-optimized GPUs, to facilitate real-time searches of gravitational wave sources and their electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts.},

To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time."

The standard method for the detection of well modeled transient gravitational-wave signals is matched filtering. However, the computational cost of such searches in low latency will grow dramatically as the low frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors improves. Convolutional neural networks provide a highly computationally efficient method for signal identification in which the majority of calculations are performed prior to data taking during a training process. We use only whitened time series of measured gravitational-wave strain as an input, and we train and test on simulated binary black hole signals in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We show that our network can classify signal from noise with a performance that emulates that of match filtering applied to the same datasets when considering the sensitivity defined by Reciever-Operator characteristics.},

This deep learning method is an extension of the Deep Filtering method used by George and Huerta (2017) for multi-inputs of network detectors. Simulated coincident time series data sets in advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors are analyzed for estimating source luminosity distance and sky location. As a classifier, our deep neural network (DNN) can effectively recognize the presence of GW signals when the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of network detectors ≥ 9. As a predictor, it can also effectively estimate the corresponding source space parameters, including the luminosity distance D, right ascension α, and declination δ of the compact binary star mergers. When the SNR of the network detectors is greater than 8, their relative errors are all less than 23%. Our results demonstrate that Deep Filtering can process coincident GW time series inputs and perform effective classification and multiple space parameter estimation. Furthermore, we compare the results obtained from one, two, and three network detectors; these results reveal that a larger number of network detectors results in a better source location.},

To promote the detection performance and efficiency, we proposed a scheme based on wavelet packet (WP) decomposition and CNN. The WP decomposition is a time-frequency method and can enhance the discriminant features between gravitational wave signal and noise before detection. The CNN conducts the gravitational wave detection by learning a function mapping relation from the data under being processed to the space of detection results. This function-mapping-relation style detection scheme can detection efficiency significantly. In this work, instrument effects are considered, and the noise are computed from a power spectral density (PSD) equivalent to the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. The quantitative evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-art method matched filtering show the excellent performances for BNS gravitational wave detection. On efficiency, the current experiments show that this WP-CNN-based scheme is more than 960 times faster than the matched filtering.},

Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are already transforming many technological fields and have also proven successful in gravitational-wave astrophysics for detection and characterization of gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes [5], [6], [7]. Here we use a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers in noisy time series representative of typical gravitational-wave detector data. Specifically, we show that a deep convolution neural network trained on 100,000 data samples can promptly identify binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals and distinguish them from noise and signals from merging black hole binaries.

The standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and chi-squared test for inspiral searches use only properties of a single matched filter at the time of an event; instead, we propose a classifier using features derived from a bank of inspiral templates around the time of each event, and also from a search using approximate sine-Gaussian templates. The classifier thus extracts additional information from strain data to discriminate inspiral signals from noise transients. We evaluate a Random Forest classifier on a set of single-detector events obtained from realistic simulated advanced LIGO data, using simulated NS-BH signals added to the data. The new classifier detects a factor of 1.5 – 2 more signals at low false positive rates as compared to the standard 're-weighted SNR' statistic, and does not require the chi-squared test to be computed. Conversely, if only the SNR and chi-squared values of single-detector events are available, Random Forest classification performs nearly identically to the re-weighted SNR.},

The multi-dimensional samples consisting of data corresponding to the statistical and physical quantities from the coherent search pipeline are fed into the artificial neural network to distinguish simulated gravitational-wave signals from background noise artifacts. Our result shows that the data classification efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability (FAP) is improved by the artificial neural network in comparison to the conventional detection statistic. Specifically, the distance at 50% detection probability at a fixed false positive rate is increased about 8%–14% for the considered waveform models. We also evaluate a few seconds of the gravitational-wave data segment using the trained networks and obtain the FAP. We suggest that the artificial neural network can be a complementary method to the conventional detection statistic for identifying gravitational-wave signals related to the short GRBs.}

The objective of this study is to compare the detection efficiency that MLAs can achieve with the efficiency of conventional detection algorithms discussed in an earlier paper. Comparisons are made using 2 distinct r-mode waveforms. For the training of the MLAs we assumed that some information about the distance to the source is given so that the training was performed over distance ranges not wider than half an order of magnitude. The results of this study suggest that machine learning algorithms are suitable for the detection of long-lived gravitational-wave transients and that when assuming knowledge of the distance to the source, MLAs are at least as efficient as conventional methods.},

However, to date, these methods have not yet been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work, we critically examine the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to search for merging black holes. We identify the strengths and limitations of this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating between machine learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the interdisciplinary challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks alone can not be used to claim a statistically significant gravitational-wave detection. However, we demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly flag the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed follow-up. Our convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications scheme. A detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates the potential of such systems as trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note of caution by constructing adversarial examples, which showcase interesting "failure modes" of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.},

In order to efficiently detect and analyze them, advanced and automatic signal processing and machine learning techniques could help to support standard tools and techniques. Another challenge relates to the large volume of data collected by the detectors on a daily basis, which creates a gap between the amount of data generated and effectively analyzed. In this paper, we propose two approaches involving deep auto-encoder models to analyze time series collected from Gravitational Waves detectors and provide a classification label (noise or real signal). The purpose is to discard noisy time series accurately and identify time series that potentially contain a real phenomenon.

  abstract      = {Studies have shown that the use of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is among the approaches with the highest potential to detect very low-frequency gravitational waves in the near future. Although the capture of gravitational waves (GWs) by PTAs has not been reported yet, many related theoretical studies and some meaningful detection limits have been reported. In this study, we focused on the nanohertz GWs from individual supermassive binary black holes. Given specific pulsars (PSR J1909-3744, PSR J1713+0747, PSR J0437-4715), the corresponding GW-induced timing residuals in PTAs with Gaussian white noise can be simulated. Further, we report the classification of the simulated PTA data and parameter estimation for potential GW sources using machine learning based on neural networks. As a classifier, the convolutional neural network shows high accuracy when the combined signal to noise ratio ≥1.33 for our simulated data. Further, we applied a recurrent neural network to estimate the chirp mass (ℳ) of the source and luminosity distance (Dp) of the pulsars and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to obtain the uncertainties of chirp mass estimation. Knowledge of the uncertainties is crucial to astrophysical observation. In our case, the mean relative error of chirp mass estimation is less than 13.6%. Although these results are achieved for simulated PTA data, we believe that they will be important for realizing intelligent processing in PTA data analysis.},

  abstract      = {Detection of gravitational waves (GW) from compact binary mergers provide a new window into multimessenger astrophysics. The standard technique to determine the merger parameters is matched filtering, consisting in comparing the signal to a template bank. This approach can be time consuming and computationally expensive due to the large amount of experimental data which needs to be analyzed. In the attempt to find more efficient data analysis methods we develop a new frequency domain convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict the merger masses from the spectrogram of the detector signal, and compare it to previous time domain neural networks (TCNN). Since FCNNs are trained using spectrograms, the dimension of the input is reduced as compared to TCNNs, implying a substantially lower number of model parameters, consequently allowing faster processing, and a better out of sample performance. We find that in general FCNN have better performance on validation data and lower over-fit, providing a new promising approach to the analysis of GW detectors data.},

For this purpose, we have developed a new data-driven discovery framework, based on deep learning. We demonstrate its use for searches involving neutrinos, optical supernovae, and gamma-rays. We show that we can match or substantially improve upon the performance of state-of-the-art techniques, while significantly minimizing the dependence on modeling and on instrument characterization. Particularly, our approach is intended for near- and real-time analyses, which are essential for effective follow-up of detections. Our algorithm is designed to combine a range of instruments and types of input data, representing different messengers, physical regimes, and temporal scales. The methodology is optimized for agnostic searches of unexpected phenomena, and has the potential to substantially enhance their discovery prospects.}

We, in this work, focus on the latency time and study the feasibility of adopting supervised machine learning (ML) method for ranking candidate GW events. We consider two popular ML methods, random forest and neural networks. We observe that the evaluation time of both methods takes tens of milliseconds for ∼ 45,000 evaluation samples. We compare the classification efficiency between the two ML methods and a conventional low-latency search method with respect to the true positive rate at given false positive rate. The comparison shows that about 10% improved efficiency can be achieved at lower false positive rate ∼ 2 × 10⁻⁵ with both ML methods. We also present that the search sensitivity can be enhanced by about 18% at ∼ 10⁻¹¹Hz false alarm rate. We conclude that adopting ML methods for ranking candidate GW events is a prospective approach to yield low latency and high efficiency in searches for GW signals from compact binary mergers.},

It is treated as a classification problem with one class for the interesting events. The proposed scheme consists of the following two successive steps: decomposing the data using a wavelet packet, representing the GW signal and noise using the derived decomposition coeficients; and determining the existence of any GW event using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a logistic regression output layer. The characteristic of this work is its comprehensive investigations on CNN structure, detection window width, data resolution, wavelet packet decomposition and detection window overlap scheme. Extensive simulation experiments show excellent performances for reliable detection of signals with a range of GW model parameters and signal-to-noise ratios. While we use a simple waveform model in this study, we expect the method to be particularly valuable when the potential GW shapes are too complex to be characterized with a template bank.},

  abstract  = {Gravitational waves are now observed routinely. Therefore, data analysis has to keep up with ever improving detectors. One relatively new tool to search for gravitational wave signals in detector data are machine learning algorithms that utilize deep neuralnnetworks. The first successful application was able to differentiate time series strain data that contains a gravitational wave from a binary black hole merger from data that consists purely of noise. This work expands the analysis to signals from binary neutron star mergers, where a rapid detection is most valuable, as electromagnetic counterparts might otherwise be missed or not observed for long enough. We showcase many different architecture, discuss what choices improved the sensitivity of our search and introduce a new multi-rate approach. We find that the final algorithm gives state of the art performance in comparison to other search pipelines that use deep neural networks. On the other hand we also conclude that our analysis is not yet able to achieve sensitivities that are on par with template based searches. We report our results at false alarm rates down to ~30 samples/month which has not been tested by other neural network algorithms. We hope to provide information about useful architectural choices and improve our algorithm in the future to achieve sensitivities and false alarm rates that rival matched filtering based approaches on.},

Matched-filtering based algorithms have traditionally been used to extract quiet signals embedded in noise. We introduce a novel neural-network based machine learning algorithm that uses time series strain data from gravitational-wave detectors to detect signals from non-spinning binary neutron star mergers. For the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, our network has an average sensitive distance of 130 Mpc at a false-alarm rate of 10 per month. Compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we find an improvement by a factor of 6 in sensitivity to signals with signal-to-noise ratio below 25. However, this approach is not yet competitive with traditional matched-filtering based methods. A conservative estimate indicates that our algorithm introduces on average 10.2 s of latency between signal arrival and generating an alert. We give an exact description of our testing procedure, which can not only be applied to machine learning based algorithms but all other search algorithms as well. We thereby improve the ability to compare machine learning and classical searches.},

The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present LIGO/Virgo, and future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.}

We assume the strain is a time series (TS) that contains a part of the orbital phase and the ring-down of the final black hole. We apply the method to the strain itself in the time domain and also in the frequency domain. We present the accuracy in the prediction of the ANNs trained with various values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The core of our results is that the estimate of the mass ratio is obtained with a small sample of training signals and resulting in predictions with errors of the order of 1\% for our best ANN configurations. }

The network is trained on a dataset containing 80% of the full publicly available catalog of numerical simulations of gravitational waves emission by binary black hole systems, including full precession effects for spinning binaries. The network predicts the remnant black holes mass and spin with an error less than 0.04% and 0.3% respectively for 90% of the values in the non-precessing test dataset, it is 0.1% and 0.3% respectively in the precessing test dataset. When compared to existing fits in the LIGO algorithm software library, the network enables to reduce the remnant mass root mean square error to one half in the non-precessing case. In the precessing case, both remnant mass and spin mean square errors are decreased to one half, and the network corrects the bias observed in available fits.}

  abstract      = {The spin distribution of binary black hole mergers contains key information concerning the formation channels of these objects, and the astrophysical environments where they form, evolve and coalesce. To quantify the suitability of deep learning to estimate the individual spins, effective spin and mass-ratio of quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers, we introduce a modified version of WaveNet trained with a novel optimization scheme that incorporates general relativistic constraints of the spin properties of astrophysical black holes. The neural network model is trained, validated and tested with 1.5 million ℓ=|m|=2 waveforms generated within the regime of validity of NRHybSur3dq8, i.e., mass-ratios q≤8 and individual black hole spins |s|1,2z≤0.8. To reduce time-to-insight, we deployed a distributed training algorithm at the IBM Power9 Hardware-Accelerated Learning cluster at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications to reduce the training stage from 1 month, using a single V100 NVIDIA GPU, to 12.4 hours using 64 V100 NVIDIA GPUs. We have also fully trained this model using 1536 V100 GPUs (256 nodes) in the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy within just 1.2 hours. Using this neural network model, we quantify how accurately we can infer the astrophysical parameters of black hole mergers in the absence of noise. We do this by computing the overlap between waveforms in the testing data set and the corresponding signals whose mass-ratio and individual spins are predicted by our neural network. We find that the convergence of high performance computing and physics-inspired optimization algorithms enable an accurate reconstruction of the mass-ratio and individual spins of binary black hole mergers across the parameter space under consideration. This is a significant step towards an informed utilization of physics-inspired deep learning models to reconstruct the spin distribution of binary black hole mergers in realistic detection scenarios.},

	title = {Enhancing the significance of gravitational wave bursts through signal classification},
	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The quest to observe gravitational waves challenges our ability to discriminate signals from detector noise. This issue is especially relevant for transient gravitational waves searches with a robust eyes wide open approach, the so called all-sky burst searches. Here we show how signal classification methods inspired by broad astrophysical characteristics can be implemented in all-sky burst searches preserving their generality. In our case study, we apply a multivariate analyses based on artificial neural networks to classify waves emitted in compact binary coalescences. We enhance by orders of magnitude the significance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the noise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of noise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We also show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be performed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in discriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future observations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing recoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of the flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient gravitational waves.}

	abstract = {We present results on the mass, spin, and redshift distributions with phenomenological population models using the 10 binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected in the first and second observing runs completed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We constrain properties of the BBH mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive BH in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1% of BHs more massive than 45  and a power-law index of α =  (90% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of BHs with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modeling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or increasing with redshift with 93% probability. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R =  Gpc−3 yr−1 (90% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of BHs via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of BHs across cosmic time.}

	abstract = {Continuous gravitational wave signals, like those expected by asymmetric spinning neutron stars, are among the most promising targets for LIGO and Virgo detectors. The development of fast and robust data analysis methods is crucial to increase the chances of a detection. We have developed a new and flexible general data analysis framework for the search of this kind of signals, which allows to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by about two orders of magnitude with respect to current procedures. This can correspond, at fixed computing cost, to a sensitivity gain of up to 10%–20%, depending on the search parameter space. Some possible applications are discussed, with a particular focus on a directed search for sources in the Galactic center. Validation through the injection of artificial signals in the data of Advanced LIGO first observational science run is also shown.}

	abstract = {Among the astrophysical sources in the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Advanced Virgo detectors’ frequency band are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational waves. Searches for these continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long stretches of data in a matched-filter framework e.g. the -statistic method. In an all-sky search for a priori unknown sources, a large number of templates are matched against the data using a pre-defined grid of variables (the gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates), subsequently producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the grid points at which the signal reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is encoded in the multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first work of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the distributions. We consider three basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency detector artifact (‘stationary line’), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and 2D versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained and tested on a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these implementations correctly classify the instances of data at various signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing concept generalization i.e. satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies. In addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and possible applications of these implementations.}

	abstract = {A central challenge in gravitational wave astronomy is identifying weak signals in the presence of non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. The separation of gravitational wave signals from noise requires good models for both. When accurate signal models are available, such as for binary Neutron star systems, it is possible to make robust detection statements even when the noise is poorly understood. In contrast, searches for ‘un-modeled’ transient signals are strongly impacted by the methods used to characterize the noise. Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet–Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model.}

We employ both a 1D CNN classification using time series gravitational-wave data as input, and a 2D CNN classification with time-frequency representation of the data as input. To test the accuracies of our 1D and 2D CNN classification, we add CCSN waveforms from the most recent hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven core-collapse to simulated Gaussian colored noise with the Virgo interferometer and the planned Einstein Telescope sensitivity curve. We find classification accuracies, for a single detector, of over ∼ 95 % for both 1D and 2D CNN pipelines. For the first time in machine learning CCSN studies, we add short duration detector noise transients to our data to test the robustness of our method against false alarms created by detector noise artifacts. Further to this, we show that the CNN can distinguish between different types of CCSN waveform models.}

Searches for gravitational-wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherent WaveBurst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors.}

Pioneering efforts on this front include citizen science campaigns adopted by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). SDSS datasets have been recently used to train neural network models to classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that overlap the footprint of both surveys. Herein, we demonstrate that knowledge from deep learning algorithms, pre-trained with real-object images, can be transferred to classify galaxies that overlap both SDSS and DES surveys, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy ≳99.6%. We demonstrate that this process can be completed within just eight minutes using distributed training. While this represents a significant step towards the classification of DES galaxies that overlap previous surveys, we need to initiate the characterization of unlabelled DES galaxies in new regions of parameter space. To accelerate this program, we use our neural network classifier to label over ten thousand unlabelled DES galaxies, which do not overlap previous surveys. Furthermore, we use our neural network model as a feature extractor for unsupervised clustering and find that unlabelled DES images can be grouped together in two distinct galaxy classes based on their morphology, which provides a heuristic check that the learning is successfully transferred to the classification of unlabelled DES images. We conclude by showing that these newly labelled datasets can be combined with unsupervised recursive training to create large-scale DES galaxy catalogs in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era."

Given the relatively small nature of existing, human-labelled star cluster samples, we transfer the knowledge of state-of-the-art neural network models for real-object recognition to classify star clusters candidates into four morphological classes. We perform a series of experiments to determine the dependence of classification performance on neural network architecture (ResNet18 and VGG19-BN), training data sets curated by either a single expert or three astronomers, and the size of the images used for training. We find that the overall classification accuracies are not significantly affected by these choices. The networks are used to classify star cluster candidates in the PHANGS-HST galaxy NGC 1559, which was not included in the training samples. The resulting prediction accuracies are 70 per cent, 40 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 50-70 per cent for class 1, 2, 3 star clusters, and class 4 non-clusters, respectively. This performance is competitive with consistency achieved in previously published human and automated quantitative classification of star cluster candidate samples (70-80 per cent, 40-50 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 60-70 per cent). The methods introduced herein lay the foundations to automate classification for star clusters at scale, and exhibit the need to prepare a standardized data set of human-labelled star cluster classifications, agreed upon by a full range of experts in the field, to further improve the performance of the networks introduced in this study.},

This is crucial in future efforts to identify the true nature of dark matter. We implement, for the first time, a classification approach to identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure. Utilizing convolutional neural networks trained on sets of simulated images, we demonstrate the feasibility of deep neural networks to reliably distinguish among different types of dark matter substructure.

  abstract      = {We propose a new model of Bayesian Neural Networks to not only detect the events of compact binary coalescence in the observational data of gravitational waves (GW) but also identify the time periods of the associated GW waveforms before the events. This is achieved by incorporating the Bayesian approach into the CLDNN classifier, which integrates together the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Our model successfully detect all seven BBH events in the LIGO Livingston O2 data, with the periods of their GW waveforms correctly labeled. The ability of a Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation enables a newly defined `awareness' state for recognizing the possible presence of signals of unknown types, which is otherwise rejected in a non-Bayesian model. Such data chunks labeled with the awareness state can then be further investigated rather than overlooked. Performance tests show that our model recognizes 90% of the events when the optimal signal-to-noise ratio $\rho_\text{opt} >7$ (100% when $\rho_\text{opt} >8.5$) and successfully labels more than 95% of the waveform periods when $\rho_\text{opt} >8$. The latency between the arrival of peak signal and generating an alert with the associated waveform period labeled is only about 20 seconds for an unoptimized code on a moderate GPU-equipped personal computer. This makes our model possible for nearly real-time detection and for forecasting the coalescence events when assisted with deeper training on a larger dataset using the state-of-art HPCs.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational waves are ripples in the space time fabric when high energy events such as black hole mergers or neutron star collisions take place. The first Gravitational Wave (GW) detection (GW150914) was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) on September 14, 2015. Furthermore, the proof of the existence of GWs had countless implications from Stellar Evolution to General Relativity. Gravitational waves detection requires multiple filters and the filtered data has to be studied intensively to come to conclusions on whether the data is a just a glitch or an actual gravitational wave detection. However, with the use of Deep Filtering the process is simplified heavily, as it reduces the level of filtering greatly, and the output is definitive and binary. This technique, Deep Filtering, uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained by a composite of real LIGO noise, and injections of GW waveform templates. The CNN effectively uses classification to differentiate weak GW time series from non-gaussian noise from glitches in the LIGO time-series. The model's sensitivity is higher than all prior studies in this field, when making real-time detections of GWs at an extremely low SNR, while still being less computationally expensive.},

We tested the method against four different data-sets: Gaussian noise with time gaps, data from the final run of Initial LIGO (S6) with signals added, the reference S6 mock data challenge data set and signals injected into data from the second advanced LIGO observing run (O2). Using the S6 mock data challenge data set and at a 1% false alarm probability we showed that at 95% efficiency a fully-automated SOAP search has a sensitivity corresponding to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio of 110, equivalent to a sensitivity depth of 10 Hz⁽-1/2), making this automated search competitive with other searches requiring significantly more computing resources and human intervention.},

Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured in integrations of the first 10⁴ orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to 10⁵ over full simulations. This computationally opens up the stability constrained characterization of multi-planet systems. Our model, trained on ≈ 100,000 three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit duration measurements for small planets, and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints (Hadden et al., 2019), SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multi-planet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.},

To address this, we present iDQ, a supervised learning framework to autonomously detect noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors based only on auxiliary degrees of freedom insensitive to gravitational waves. iDQ has operated in low latency throughout the advanced detector era at each of the two LIGO interferometers, providing invaluable data quality information about each detection to date in real-time. We document the algorithm, describing the statistical framework and possible applications within gravitational-wave searches. In particular, we construct a likelihood-ratio test that simultaneously accounts for the presence of non-Gaussian noise artifacts and utilizes information from both the observed gravitational-wave strain signal and thousands of auxiliary degrees of freedom. We also present several examples of iDQ's performance with modern interferometers, showing iDQ's ability to autonomously reproduce known data quality monitors and identify noise artifacts not flagged by other analyses.},

  abstract = {The field of gravitational wave astronomy is still in its early stages, with published detections of compact binary coalescences numbering 14 and the most recent observing run (O3) providing 50 more candidates. Another possible source of gravitational waves is rapidly rotating neutron stars which can emit gravitational waves if they have some asymmetry around their rotation axis. These are predicted to emit long duration quasi-sinusoidal signals known as continuous gravitational waves.All-sky and wide parameter space searches for continuous gravitational waves are generally template-matching schemes which test a bank of signal waveforms against data from a gravitational wave detector. Often these searches are highly-tuned to specific signal types and are computationally expensive. We have developed a search method (entitled SOAP) based on the Viterbi algorithm which is model-agnostic and has a computational cost several orders of magnitude lower than template methods and with a comparable sensitivity. In particular, this method can search for signals which have an unknown frequency evolution. We test the algorithm on three simulated and real data sets: gapless Gaussian noise, Gaussian noise with gaps and real data from the final run of initial LIGO (S6). We show that at 95% efficiency, with a 1% false alarm rate, the algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 60, 72 and 74 in the optimal coherent signal to noise ratio in each of these datasets. We discuss the use of this algorithm for detecting a wide range of quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signals and instrumental artefacts, and demonstrate that it can also identify shorter duration signals such as compact binary coalescences.Many continuous gravitational wave searches are affected by instrumental lines as the long duration narrowband nature of a line can appear to be very similar to a real continuous gravitational wave signal. This has led to the development of techniques to try and limit the effect of instrumental lines, which mostly involve developing a statistic to penalise signals that appear in only a single detector. Whilst these statistics limit the effect of instrumental lines, in the SOAP search described above, many lines still contaminate the statistics and have to be manually removed by investigating other search outputs. We have developed a method using convolutional neural networks to reduce the impact of instrumental artefacts on the SOAP search described above. This has the ability to identify features in each of the detectors spectrograms such that a frequency band can be classified into a signal or noise class. This limits the amount of manual investigation of frequency bands and allowed the SOAP search to be fully automated without a reduction in the sensitivity.Once a continuous gravitational wave is detected, we would want to extract some parameters associated with the source to help understand more about its structure and evolution. We describe a Bayesian method which extracts the sky location, frequency, frequency derivative and signal to noise ratio of a source associated with the frequency evolution returned by the SOAP algorithm. This has the aim of limiting the size of the parameter space for a more sensitive fully coherent follow up search. We tested this approach on 200 simulations in Gaussian noise, generating posterior distributions for the parameters described above. In 90% of these simulations we limit the sky area to 45 deg² with a 95% confidence contour. However, we find that this contour contains the true parameter only 42% of the time. We present these results and describe the features and shortcomings of our approach.As mentioned above, we limit the effect of instrumental lines on the SOAP search using machine learning, however we can also identify and mitigate these lines separately before a search is run. We demonstrate how we can use SOAP in a simple configuration to identify instrumental lines. We compare this method to existing line identification tools used in the LIGO collaboration, and find that using the Viterbi statistic SOAP identifies 37% of the same lines as these methods, where for many of the lines which were not identified, other SOAP outputs do show evidence of a line. With further investigation, we expect to identify many more lines in common with existing methods. As well as these common lines, the SOAP algorithm returned 150 more 0.1 Hz wide bands which potentially contain an instrumental line and did not appear on LIGO line-lists.},

Gravitational waves carry the imprint of the internal composition of neutron stars via the so-called tidal deformability parameter, which depends on the stellar equation of state and is equal to zero for black holes. We present a new data analysis strategy powered by Bayesian inference and machine learning to identify mixed binaries, hence low-mass black holes, using the distribution of the tidal deformability parameter inferred from gravitational-wave observations.},

  abstract = {As the observations of gravitational waves from coalescence of compact objects are expected to be more frequent in the near future, the need for an accurate and fast gravitational waves data analysis framework is becoming more and more relevant. Any analysis requires a waveform model capable of predicting the shape of the gravitational wave signal, given the physical parameters of the source. Currently, several models exist, but they are cursed by the fact that they are slow to compute, hence they are the bottleneck of the task of extracting physical information from the raw data. In our work, we apply Machine Learning methods to build a model designed to generate a gravitational waveform in the time domain as produced by a binary black hole coalescence. Our model matches in accuracy the performance of the state-of-the-art direct computations while, at the same time, it provides a speed up of a a factor of ∼ 30 in the generation of the waveform. Furthermore, our model provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters. This open the possibility to further improve the sampling algorithms used for the parameter estimation. We train our model on a number of waveforms computed by the SEOBNRv2 generator and we infer a relation between the waveform and the masses m1,m2 and spins s1, s2 of the two BHs. In this work, we consider only the case in which the two spins are aligned to the orbital angular momentum. We reduce the dimensionality of our problem by decomposing each waveform in amplitude and phase and it is further represented in a lower dimensional space using a Principal Component Analysis. The regression from orbital parameters to principal components is performed using a Mixture of Expert model. Our implementation is publicly available as a Python package mlgw as https: //pypi.org/project/mlgw/. mlgw has all the features required for performing a full parameter estimation (including the waveform dependence on geometrical parameters). We demonstrate the faithfulness of mlgw by successfully reproducing the inference on GW150914 made by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational wave searches for continuous-wave signals from neutron stars are especially challenging when the star's spin frequency is unknown a priori from electromagnetic observations and wanders stochastically under the action of internal (e.g. superfluid or magnetospheric) or external (e.g. accretion) torques. It is shown that frequency tracking by hidden Markov model (HMM) methods can be combined with existing maximum likelihood coherent matched filters like the F-statistic to surmount some of the challenges raised by spin wandering. Specifically it is found that, for an isolated, biaxial rotor whose spin frequency walks randomly, HMM tracking of the F-statistic output from coherent segments with duration T_drift = 10d over a total observation time of T_obs = 1yr can detect signals with wave strains h0 > 2e-26 at a noise level characteristic of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO). For a biaxial rotor with randomly walking spin in a binary orbit, whose orbital period and semi-major axis are known approximately from electromagnetic observations, HMM tracking of the Bessel-weighted F-statistic output can detect signals with h0 > 8e-26. An efficient, recursive, HMM solver based on the Viterbi algorithm is demonstrated, which requires 10³ CPU-hours for a typical, broadband (0.5-kHz) search for the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, including generation of the relevant F-statistic input. In a "realistic" observational scenario, Viterbi tracking successfully detects 41 out of 50 synthetic signals without spin wandering in Stage I of the Scorpius X-1 Mock Data Challenge convened by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration down to a wave strain of h0 = 1.1e-25, recovering the frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of <= 4.3e-3 Hz.},

  abstract      = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) scheme for tracking continuous-wave gravitational radiation from neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with wandering spin is extended by introducing a frequency-domain matched filter, called the J-statistic, which sums the signal power in orbital sidebands coherently. The J-statistic is similar but not identical to the binary-modulated F-statistic computed by demodulation or resampling. By injecting synthetic LMXB signals into Gaussian noise characteristic of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), it is shown that the J-statistic HMM tracker detects signals with characteristic wave strain h_0 ≥ 2 × 10⁻²⁶ in 370 d of data from two interferometers, divided into 37 coherent blocks of equal length. When applied to data from Stage I of the Scorpius X-1 Mock Data Challenge organised by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the tracker detects all 50 closed injections (h_0 ≥ 6.84 × 10⁻²⁶), recovering the frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of ≤ 1.95×10⁻⁵ Hz. Of the 50 injections, 43 (with h_0 ≥ 1.09 × 10⁻²⁵) are detected in a single, coherent 10-d block of data. The tracker employs an efficient, recursive HMM solver based on the Viterbi algorithm, which requires ∼ 10⁵ CPU-hours for a typical, broadband (0.5-kHz), LMXB search.},

We describe an efficient frequency tracking scheme based on a hidden Markov model to search for long-duration transient signals from a neutron star remnant with spin-down time-scale in the range ∼ 10²s-10⁴s. It was one of the methods used in the search for signals from a long-lived remnant of GW170817. We validate the method and estimate its sensitivity through Monte-Carlo simulations on the same data set as used in the GW170817 search. We describe the search configuration, procedure, and follow-up step by step. The methodology of the hidden Markov model is described fully to ensure that future analyses of this kind can be reproduced by an independent party.},

  abstract      = {[Abridged] We introduce an improved version of the Eccentric, Non-spinning, Inspiral-Gaussian-process Merger Approximant (ENIGMA) waveform model. We find that this ready-to-use model can: (i) produce physically consistent signals when sampling over 1M samples chosen over the $m_{\{1,\,2\}}\in[5M_{\odot},\,50M_{\odot}]$ parameter space, and the entire range of binary inclination angles; (ii) produce waveforms within 0.04 seconds from an initial gravitational wave frequency $f_{\textrm{GW}} =15\,\textrm{Hz}$ and at a sample rate of 8192 Hz; and (iii) reproduce the physics of quasi-circular mergers. We utilize ENIGMA to compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions of eccentric binary black hole mergers assuming the existence of second and third generation gravitational wave detector networks that include the twin LIGO detectors, Virgo, KAGRA, LIGO-India, a LIGO-type detector in Australia, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein Telescope. In the context of advanced LIGO-type detectors, we find that the SNR of eccentric mergers is always larger than quasi-circular mergers for systems with $e_0\leq0.4$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$, even if the timespan of eccentric signals is just a third of quasi-circular systems with identical total mass and mass-ratio. For Cosmic Explorer-type detector networks, we find that eccentric mergers have similar SNRs than quasi-circular systems for $e_0\leq0.3$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$. Systems with $e_0\sim0.5$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$ have SNRs that range between 50%-90% of the SNR produced by quasi-circular mergers, even if these eccentric signals are just between a third to a tenth the length of quasi-circular systems. For Einstein Telescope-type detectors, we find that eccentric mergers have similar SNRs than quasi-circular systems for $e_0\leq0.4$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =5\,\textrm{Hz}$.},

As the rate of detections grows with detector sensitivity, this poses a growing computational challenge for data analysis. With this in mind, in this work we apply deep learning techniques to perform fast likelihood-free Bayesian inference for gravitational waves. We train a neural-network conditional density estimator to model posterior probability distributions over the full 15-dimensional space of binary black hole system parameters, given detector strain data from multiple detectors. We use the method of normalizing flows—specifically, a neural spline normalizing flow—which allows for rapid sampling and density estimation. Training the network is likelihood-free, requiring samples from the data generative process, but no likelihood evaluations. Through training, the network learns a global set of posteriors: it can generate thousands of independent posterior samples per second for any strain data consistent with the prior and detector noise characteristics used for training. By training with the detector noise power spectral density estimated at the time of GW150914, and conditioning on the event strain data, we use the neural network to generate accurate posterior samples consistent with analyses using conventional sampling techniques.},

  abstract      = {A KL-divergence objective of the joint distribution of data and labels allows to unify supervised learning, VAEs and semi-supervised learning under one umbrella of variational inference. This viewpoint has several advantages. For VAEs, it clarifies the interpretation of encoder and decoder parts. For supervised learning, it re-iterates that the training procedure approximates the true posterior over labels and can always be viewed as approximate likelihood-free inference. This is typically not discussed, even though the derivation is well-known in the literature. In the context of semi-supervised learning it motivates an extended supervised scheme which allows to calculate a goodness-of-fit p-value using posterior predictive simulations. Flow-based networks with a standard normal base distribution are crucial. We discuss how they allow to rigorously define coverage for arbitrary joint posteriors on ℝⁿ × 𝓢ᵐ, which encompasses posteriors over directions. Finally, systematic uncertainties are naturally included in the variational viewpoint. With the three ingredients of (1) systematics, (2) coverage and (3) goodness-of-fit, flow-based neural networks have the potential to replace a large part of the statistical toolbox of the contemporary high-energy physicist.},

  abstract      = {A network of three or more gravitational wave detectors simultaneously taking data is required to generate a well-localized sky map for gravitational wave sources, such as GW170817. Local seismic disturbances often cause the LIGO and Virgo detectors to lose light resonance in one or more of their component optic cavities, and the affected detector is unable to take data until resonance is recovered. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to gain insight into the predictive behavior of the LIGO detector optic cavities during the second LIGO–Virgo observing run. We identify a minimal set of optic cavity control signals and data features which capture interferometer behavior leading to a loss of light resonance, or lockloss. We use these channels to accurately distinguish between lockloss events and quiet interferometer operating times via both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. This analysis yields new insights into how components of the LIGO detectors contribute to lockloss events, which could inform detector commissioning efforts to mitigate the associated loss of uptime. Particularly, we find that the state of the component optical cavities is a better predictor of loss of lock than ground motion trends. We report prediction accuracies of 98% for times just prior to lock loss, and 90% for times up to 30 s prior to lockloss, which shows promise for this method to be applied in near-real time to trigger preventative detector state changes. This method can be extended to target other auxiliary subsystems or times of interest, such as transient noise or loss in detector sensitivity. Application of these techniques during the third LIGO–Virgo observing run and beyond would maximize the potential of the global detector network for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves.},

This deformation is well approximated by the tidal deformability parameter Λ, which was constrained using the first binary neutron star gravitational-wave observation, GW170817. Now, with the measurement of the second binary neutron star, GW190425, we can combine different gravitational-wave measurements to obtain tighter constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. In this paper, we combine data from GW170817 and GW190425 to place constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. To facilitate this calculation, we derive interpolated marginalized likelihoods for each event using a machine learning algorithm. These likelihoods, which we make publicly available, allow for results from multiple gravitational-wave signals to be easily combined. Using these new data products, we find that the radius of a fiducial 1.4M⊙ neutron star is constrained to 11.6⁽+1.6)_(-0.9)km at 90% confidence and the pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density is constrained to 3.1⁽+3.1)_(-1.3)× 10³⁴dyne/cm2 at 90% confidence.

This search improves on previous HMM-based searches of LIGO data by using an improved frequency domain matched filter, the 𝓙-statistic, and by analysing data from Advanced LIGO's second observing run. In the frequency range searched, from 60 to 650 \mathrm{Hz}{}{,} we find no evidence of gravitational radiation. At 194.6 \mathrm{Hz}{}{,} the most sensitive search frequency, we report an upper limit on gravitational wave strain (at 95% confidence) of h_0^(95%) = 3.47 × 10⁻²⁵ when marginalising over source inclination angle. This is the most sensitive search for Scorpius X-1, to date, that is specifically designed to be robust in the presence of spin wandering.},

  month         = aug,
  abstract      = {Inferring the properties of black holes and neutron stars is a key science goal of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. To extract as much information as possible from GW observations we must develop methods to reduce the cost of Bayesian inference. In this paper, we use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the parallelisation power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the surrogate modelling method, which can produce accelerated versions of existing models. As a first application of our method, ANN-Sur, we build a time-domain surrogate model of the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) waveform model SEOBNRv4. We achieve median mismatches of 2e-5 and mismatches no worse than 2e-3. For a typical BBH waveform generated from 12 Hz with a total mass of 60 M_⊙ the original SEOBNRv4 model takes 1812 ms. Existing bespoke code optimisations (SEOBNRv4opt) reduced this to 91.6 ms and the interpolation based, frequency-domain surrogate SEOBNRv4ROM can generate this waveform in 6.9 ms. Our ANN-Sur model, when run on a CPU takes 2.7 ms and just 0.4 ms when run on a GPU. ANN-Sur can also generate large batches of waveforms simultaneously. We find that batches of up to 10⁴ waveforms can be evaluated on a GPU in just 163 ms, corresponding to a time per waveform of 0.016 ms. This method is a promising way to utilise the parallelisation power of GPUs to drastically increase the computational efficiency of Bayesian parameter estimation.},

  title         = {Deep Learning for Gravitational-wave Data Analysis: A Resampling White-box Approach},
  year          = {2020},
  month         = sep,
  abstract      = {In this work, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals of compact binary coalescences, using single-interferometer data from LIGO detectors. As novel contribution, we adopted a resampling white-box approach to advance towards a statistical understanding of uncertainties intrinsic to CNNs in GW data analysis. Resampling is performed by repeated k-fold cross-validation experiments, and for a white-box approach, behavior of CNNs is mathematically described in detail. Through a Morlet wavelet transform, strain time series are converted to time-frequency images, which in turn are reduced before generating input datasets. Moreover, to reproduce more realistic experimental conditions, we worked only with data of non-Gaussian noise and hardware injections, removing freedom to set signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in GW templates by hand. After hyperparameter adjustments, we found that resampling smooths stochasticity of mini-batch stochastic gradient descend by reducing mean accuracy perturbations in a factor of 3.6. CNNs were quite precise to detect noise but not sensitive enough to recall GW signals, meaning that CNNs are better for noise reduction than generation of GW triggers. However, applying a post-analysis, we found that for GW signals of SNR ≥ 21.80 with H1 data and SNR ≥ 26.80 with L1 data, CNNs could remain as tentative alternatives for detecting GW signals. Besides, with receiving operating characteristic curves we found that CNNs show much better performances than those of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines models and, with a significance level of 5%, we estimated that predictions of CNNs are significant different from those of a random classifier. Finally, we elucidated that performance of CNNs is highly class dependent because of the distribution of probabilistic scores outputted by the softmax layer.},

  abstract      = {The search and follow-up observation of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational waves (GW) is a current hot topic of GW cosmology. Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS). It consists of three parts: a pipeline to select host candidates of GW and sort their priorities for follow-up observation, an identification module to find the transient from follow-up observation data, and a visualization module to display GW-related data. GWOPS can rapidly respond to GW events. With GWOPS, the operations such as follow-up observation planning, data storage, data visualization, and transient identification can be efficiently coordinated, which will promote the success searching rate for GWs EM counterparts.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational wave astronomy has been already a well-established research domain for many years. Moreover, after the detection by LIGO/Virgo collaboration, in 2017, of the first gravitational wave signal emitted during the collision of a binary neutron star system, that was accompanied by the detection of other types of signals coming from the same event, multi-messenger astronomy has claimed its rights more assertively. In this context, it is of great importance in a gravitational wave experiment to have a rapid mechanism of alerting about potential gravitational waves events other observatories capable to detect other types of signals (e.g. in other wavelengths) that are produce by the same event. In this paper, we present the first progress in the development of a neural network algorithm trained to recognize and characterize gravitational wave patterns from signal plus noise data samples. We have implemented two versions of the algorithm, one that classifies the gravitational wave signals into 2 classes, and another one that classifies them into 4 classes, according to the mass ratio of the emitting source. We have obtained promising results, with 100% training and testing accuracy for the 2-class network and approximately 95% for the 4-class network. We conclude that the current version of the neural network algorithm demonstrates the ability of a well-configured and calibrated Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory software to classify with very high accuracy and in an extremely short time gravitational wave signals, even when they are accompanied by noise. Moreover, the performance obtained with this algorithm qualifies it as a fast method of data analysis and can be used as a low-latency pipeline for gravitational wave observatories like the future LISA Mission.},

  abstract      = {All-sky observations of the Milky Way show both Galactic and non-Galactic diffuse emission, for example from interstellar matter or the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The different emitters are partly superimposed in the measurements, partly they obscure each other, and sometimes they dominate within a certain spectral range. The decomposition of the underlying radiative components from spectral data is a signal reconstruction problem and often associated with detailed physical modeling and substantial computational effort. We aim to build an effective and self-instructing algorithm detecting the essential spectral information contained Galactic all-sky data covering spectral bands from γ-ray to radio waves. Utilizing principles from information theory, we develop a state-of-the-art variational autoencoder specialized on the adaption to Gaussian noise statistics. We first derive a generic generative process that leads from a low-dimensional set of emission features to the observed high-dimensional data. We formulate a posterior distribution of these features using Bayesian methods and approximate this posterior with variational inference. The algorithm efficiently encodes the information of 35 Galactic emission data sets in ten latent feature maps. These contain the essential information required to reconstruct the initial data with high fidelity and are ranked by the algorithm according to their significance for data regeneration. The three most significant feature maps encode astrophysical components: (1) The dense interstellar medium (ISM), (2) the hot and dilute regions of the ISM and (3) the CMB. The machine-assisted and data-driven dimensionality reduction of spectral data is able to uncover the physical features encoding the input data. Our algorithm is able to extract the dense and dilute Galactic regions, as well as the CMB, from the sky brightness values only.},

Gravity fluctuations result from density perturbations associated with environmental fields, e.g., seismic and acoustic fields, which are characterized by complex spatial correlations. Measurements of these fields necessarily provide incomplete information, and the question is how to make optimal use of available information for the design of a noise-cancellation system. In this paper, we present a machine-learning approach to calculate a surrogate model of a Wiener filter. The model is used to calculate optimal configurations of seismometer arrays for a varying number of sensors, which is the missing keystone for the design of NN cancellation systems. The optimization results indicate that efficient noise cancellation can be achieved even for complex seismic fields with relatively few seismometers provided that they are deployed in optimal configurations. In the form presented here, the optimization method can be applied to all current and future gravitational-wave detectors located at the surface and with minor modifications also to future underground detectors.},

They lead to fast gravitational wave detection and parameter inference and hence complement classical slower techniques. This work explores simulation based inference which relies on likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation for the parameters of binary black holes mergers. We build a neural network modeling this ratio and use it in place of the simulator allowing to perform parameter inference in few minutes.

There is a need for the development of fast and efficient algorithms to detect non-astrophysical transients and noises due to the rate and scale at which the data is being provided by LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories. These transients and noises can interfere with the study of gravitational waves and binary mergers and induce false positives. Here, we propose the use of deep learning algorithms to detect and classify these transient signals. Traditional statistical methods are not well designed for dealing with temporal signals but supervised deep learning techniques such as RNN-LSTM and deep CNN have proven to be effective for solving problems such as time-series forecasting and time-series classification. We also use unsupervised models such as Total variation, Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Wavelet decomposition or Random Forests for feature extraction and noise reduction and then study the results obtained by RNN-LSTM and deep CNN for classifying the transients in low-SNR signals. We compare the results obtained by the combination of various unsupervised models and supervised models. This method can be extended to real-time detection of transients and merger signals using deep-learning optimized GPU's for early prediction and study of various astronomical events. We will also explore and compare other machine learning models such as MLP, Stacked Autoencoder, Random forests, extreme learning machine, Support Vector machine and logistic regression classifier.},

The standard technique to determine the merger parameters is matched filtering, consisting in comparing the signal to a template bank. This approach can be time consuming and computationally expensive due to the large amount of experimental data which needs to be analyzed. In the attempt to find more efficient data analysis methods we develop a new frequency domain convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict the merger masses from the spectrogram of the detector signal, and compare it to time domain neural networks (TCNN). Since FCNNs are trained using spectrograms, the dimension of the input is reduced as compared to TCNNs, implying a substantially lower number of model parameters, and consequently less over-fitting. The additional time required to compute the spectrogram is approximately compensated by the lower execution time of the FCNNs, due to the lower number of parameters. In our analysis FCNNs show a slightly better performance on validation data and a substantially lower over-fit, as expected due to the lower number of parameters, providing a new promising approach to the analysis of GW detectors data, which could be further improved in the future by using more efficient and faster computations of the spectrogram.},

Unfortunately, training these CNNs requires a precise model of the target signal; they are therefore not applicable to a wide class of potential gravitational-wave sources, such as core-collapse supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts, where unknown physics or computational limitations prevent the development of comprehensive signal models. We demonstrate for the first time a CNN with the ability to detect generic signals – those without a precise model – with sensitivity across a wide parameter space. Our CNN has a novel structure that uses not only the network strain data but also the Pearson cross-correlation between detectors to distinguish correlated gravitational-wave signals from uncorrelated noise transients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CNN using data from the second LIGO-Virgo observing run, and show that it has sensitivity comparable to that of the "gold-standard" transient searches currently used by LIGO-Virgo, at extremely low (order of 1 second) latency and using only a fraction of the computing power required by existing searches, allowing our models the possibility of true real-time detection of gravitational-wave transients associated with gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, and other relativistic astrophysical phenomena.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational-wave detection strategies are based on a signal analysis technique known as matched filtering. Matched filtering is known to be optimal under certain conditions, yet in practice, these conditions are only approximately satisfied while the algorithm is computationally expensive. Despite the success of matched filtering for signal detection, due to these limitations, there has been recent interest in developing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for signal detection. Designing these networks remains a challenge as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy to set the hyperparameter values. We propose and develop a new method for hyperparameter optimization based on genetic algorithms (GAs). We compare six different GA variants and explore different choices for the GA-optimized fitness score. We show that the GA can discover high-quality architectures when the initial hyperparameter seed values are far from a good solution as well as refining already good networks. For example, when starting from the architecture proposed by George and Huerta, the network optimized over the 20-dimensional hyperparameter space has 78% fewer trainable parameters while obtaining an 11% increase in accuracy for our test problem. Using genetic algorithm optimization to refine an existing network should be especially useful if the problem context (e.g. statistical properties of the noise, signal model, etc) changes and one needs to rebuild a network. In all of our experiments, we find the GA discovers significantly less complicated networks as compared to the seed network, suggesting it can be used to prune wasteful network structures. While we have restricted our attention to CNN classifiers, GA hyperparameter optimization can be applied within other machine learning settings, including alternative architectures for signal classification, parameter inference, or other tasks.},

  abstract      = {We present a novel Machine Learning (ML) based strategy to search for compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in data from ground-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories. This is the first ML-based search that not only recovers all the binary black hole mergers in the first GW transients calalog (GWTC-1), but also makes a clean detection of GW151216, which was not significant enough to be included in the catalogue. Moreover, we achieve this by only adding a new coincident ranking statistic (MLStat) to a standard analysis that was used for GWTC-1. In CBC searches, reducing contamination by terrestrial and instrumental transients, which create a loud noise background by triggering numerous false alarms, is crucial to improving the sensitivity for detecting true events. The sheer volume of data and and large number of expected detections also prompts the use of ML techniques. We perform transfer learning to train "InceptionV3", a pre-trained deep neural network, along with curriculum learning to distinguish GW signals from noisy events by analysing their continuous wavelet transform (CWT) maps. MLStat incorporates information from this ML classifier into the standard coincident search likelihood used by the conventional search. This leads to at least an order of magnitude improvement in the inverse false-alarm-rate (IFAR) for the previously "low significance" events GW151012, GW170729 and GW151216. The confidence in detection of GW151216 is further strengthened by performing its parameter estimation using \waveform. Considering the impressive ability of the statistic to distinguish signals from glitches, the list of marginal events from MLStat could be quite reliable for astrophysical population studies and further follow-up. This work demonstrates the immense potential and readiness of MLStat for finding new sources in current data and possibility of its adaptation in similar searches.},

In this article, we introduce VAMANA, which reconstructs the binary black-hole population using a mixture model and facilitates excellent fitting of the model with the data. VAMANA uses a mixture of weighted Gaussians to reconstruct the chirp mass distribution. We expect Gaussian mixtures to provide flexibility in modeling complex distributions and enable us in capturing details in the astrophysical chirp mass distribution. Each of the Gaussian in the mixture is combined with another Gaussian and a power-law to simultaneously model the spin component aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the mass-ratio distribution, thus also allowing us to capture their variation with the chirp mass. Additionally, we can also introduce broadband smoothing by restricting the Gaussian mixture to lie within a threshold distance of a predefined reference chirp mass distribution. Using simulated data we show the robustness of our method in reconstructing complex population for a large number of observations. We also apply our method on the publicly available catalog of \ac{GW} observations made during LIGO's and Virgo's first and second observation runs and present the reconstructed mass, spin distribution, and the estimated merger rate of binary black-holes.},

  abstract      = {The propagation path of gravitational waves is expected to be bent near massive astrophysical objects. The massive object acts as a lens. Similarly to the lensing of electromagnetic waves, the lens amplifies gravitational waves' amplitude and can produce multiple gravitational-wave images. If we suppose the positions of lens and source of a gravitational wave deviate from the line of sight, the gravitational-wave images arrive at different times because they have traveled different trajectories around the lens at the same speed. Depending on the difference in their arrival times, multiple gravitational waves can be detected as repeated, near-identical events, or superposed gravitational waves with characteristic "beating patterns". In particular, when the lens is small, ≲ 10⁵ M_⊙, the lens produces images with short time delays that result in the beating patterns. We utilize deep learning to study the lensing signature. It is known that many state-of-the-art deep learning models are excellent at recognizing foreground images, similar to spectrograms, from background noises. In this work, we study the feasibility of applying deep learning to identify lensing signatures from the spectrogram of gravitational-wave signals detectable by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. We assume the lens mass is around 10³ M_⊙ – 10⁵ M_⊙ which can produce the order of millisecond time delays between two images of lensed gravitational waves. We discuss the feasibility of two aspects: distinguishing lensed gravitational waves from unlensed ones and estimating the parameters related to not only the lensing factor but also the source binary system and lens. We suggest that the approach of this work would be of particular interest for more complicated lensings for which we do not have accurate waveform templates.},

Such substructure is hard to model and is either ignored by traditional, smooth modelling, approaches, or treated as well-localized massive perturbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to quantify the statistical properties of such perturbations directly from images, where only the extended lensed source features within a mask are considered, without the need of any lens modelling. Our training data consist of mock lensed images assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens potential, and, for the first time, using images of real galaxies as the lensed source. We employ a novel deep neural network that can handle arbitrary uncertainty intervals associated with the training dataset labels as input, provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss function. The method succeeds not only in accurately estimating the actual parameter values, but also reduces the predicted confidence intervals by 10 per cent in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without having access to the actual ground truth values. Our results are invariant to the inherent degeneracy between mass perturbations in the lens and complex brightness profiles for the source. Hence, we can quantitatively and robustly quantify the smoothness of the mass density of thousands of lenses, including confidence intervals, and provide a consistent ranking for follow-up science.},

  abstract  = {The first direct detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars started the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. Since then, observing merging compact objects has become routine. Other exciting sources still remain undetected. Rapidly-rotating neutron stars are predicted to emit weak, long-lasting quasi-monochromatic waves called continuous gravitational waves (CWs). In the current detector generation, advanced LIGO and Virgo, various noise sources create far more signal output than a potential CW signal. CW data analysis tries to overcome the weakness of the signals by integrating over long stretches of data. Analyzing large amounts of data usually corresponds to large computing cost. For that reason, CW searches for signals from unknown neutron stars are limited in their sensitivity by computational cost. This thesis is concerned with estimating and improving the sensitivity of continuous gravita- tional wave searches. The first main research work presented in this thesis is a new sensitivity estimator that can swiftly and accurately predict the sensitivity of a CW search before it is started. This makes optimizing the search algorithms and therefore improving the sensitivity easier. The accuracy of the estimator is studied by applying it to many different CW searches. The work is expanded with an extensive sensitivity review of past CW searches by calculating their sensitivity depth. The second main part of this thesis is the development of a new CW search method based on deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs are extremely fast once trained and therefore might present an interesting possibility of circumventing the computational limitations and creating a more sensitive CW search. In this thesis such a DNN CW search is developed first as a single-detector search for signals from all over the sky and then expanded to a multi-detector all-sky search and to directed multi-detector searches for signals from a single position in the sky. The DNNs’ performance is compared to coherent matched-filtering searches in terms of detection probability at fixed false-alarm level first on idealized Gaussian noise and then on realistic LIGO detector noise. This thesis finds that the DNNs show a lot of potential: For short timespans of about one day the networks only lose a few percent in sensitivity depth compared to coherent matched- filtering. For longer timespans the networks’ performance gradually deteriorates making further research necessary. As an outlook to future research, this thesis proposes the combination of short-timespan network outputs, similar to semi-coherent matched-filtering, as a DNN search method over longer timespans.},

Because the evaluation of the likelihood function requires evaluating millions of waveform models that link between signal shapes and the source parameters, running Markov chains until convergence is typically expensive and requires days of computation. In this extended abstract, we provide a proof of concept that demonstrates how the latest advances in neural simulation-based inference can speed up the inference time by up to three orders of magnitude – from days to minutes – without impairing the performance. Our approach is based on a convolutional neural network modeling the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and entirely amortizes the computation of the posterior.

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present the first study that compares different models of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to predict the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters directly from the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization maps. We focus our analysis on four different methods to sample the weights of the network during training: Dropout, DropConnect, Reparameterization Trick (RT), and Flipout. We find out that Flipout outperforms all other methods regardless of the architecture used, and provides tighter constraints for the cosmological parameters. Moreover we compare with MCMC posterior analysis obtaining comparable error correlation among parameters, with BNNs being orders of magnitude faster in inference, although less accurate. Thanks to the speed of the inference process with BNNs, the posterior distribution, outcome of the neural network, can be used as the initial proposal for the Markov Chain. We show that this combined approach increases the acceptance rate in the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and accelerates the convergence of the MCMC, while reaching the same final accuracy. In the second part of the paper, we present a guide to the training and calibration of a successful multi-channel BNN for the CMB temperature and polarization map. We show how tuning the regularization parameter for the standard deviation of the approximate posterior on the weights in Flipout and RT we can produce unbiased and reliable uncertainty estimates, i.e., the regularizer acts like a hyperparameter analogous to the dropout rate in Dropout. Finally, we show how polarization, when combined with the temperature in a unique multi-channel tensor fed to a single BNN, helps to break degeneracies among parameters and provides stringent constraints.},

Our findings indicate that our approach identifies real gravitational wave sources in advanced LIGO data with a false positive rate of 1 misclassification for every 2.7 days of searched data. A follow up of these misclassifications identified them as glitches. Our deep learning ensemble represents the first class of neural network classifiers that are trained with millions of modeled waveforms that describe quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing, binary black hole mergers. Once fully trained, our deep learning ensemble processes advanced LIGO strain data faster than real-time using 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.},

We constrain PBH formation models within a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning techniques, finding best-fit values for distinctive features of these models, including the PBH initial mass function, the fraction of PBHs in dark matter, and the accretion efficiency. The presence of several spinning binaries in the GWTC-2 dataset favors a scenario in which PBHs accrete and spin up. Our results indicate that PBHs may comprise only a fraction smaller than 0.3 % of the total dark matter, and that the predicted PBH abundance is still compatible with other constraints.},

We train mlgw on about 𝓞(10³) TEOBResumS and SEOBNRv4 effective-one-body waveforms with mass ratios q∈[1,20] and aligned dimensionless spins s∈[-0.80,0.95]. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the ∼10⁻³ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors.

In this paper, we combine the 𝙲𝙾𝚂𝙼𝙸𝙲 binary population synthesis suite and the 𝙲𝙼𝙲 code for globular cluster evolution to create a mixture model for black hole binary formation under both formation scenarios. For the first time, these code bodies are combined self-consistently, with 𝙲𝙼𝙲 itself employing 𝙲𝙾𝚂𝙼𝙸𝙲 to track stellar evolution. We then use a deep-learning enhanced hierarchical Bayesian analysis to constrain the mixture fraction f between formation models, while simultaneously constraining the common envelope efficiency α assumed in 𝙲𝙾𝚂𝙼𝙸𝙲 and the initial cluster virial radius r_v assumed in 𝙲𝙼𝙲. Under specific assumptions about other uncertain aspects of isolated binary and globular cluster evolution, we report the median and 90% confidence interval of three physical parameters (f,α,r_v)=(0.20⁽+0.32)_(-0.18),2.26⁽+2.65)_(-1.84),2.71⁽+0.83)_(-1.17)).

Using the collisionless Boltzmann equation, we then find the gravitational potential - represented by a feed-forward neural network - that renders this distribution function stationary.

We show that an ensemble of solutions obtained using an arbitrarily precise numerical integrator can be used to train a deep artificial neural network (ANN) that, over a bounded time interval, provides accurate solutions at fixed computational cost and up to 100 million times faster than a state-of-the-art solver. Our results provide evidence that, for computationally challenging regions of phase-space, a trained ANN can replace existing numerical solvers, enabling fast and scalable simulations of many-body systems to shed light on outstanding phenomena such as the formation of black-hole binary systems or the origin of the core collapse in dense star clusters.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning methods are powerful in distinguishing different phases of matter in an automated way and provide a new perspective on the study of physical phenomena. We train a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) on data constructed with spin configurations sampled from the Ising Hamiltonian at different values of temperature and external magnetic field using Monte Carlo methods. From the trained machine we obtain the flow of iterative reconstruction of spin state configurations to faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. We find that the flow of the trained RBM approaches the spin configurations of the maximal possible specific heat which resemble the near criticality region of the Ising model. In the special case of the vanishing magnetic field the trained RBM converges to the critical point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the lattice model. Our results suggest an alternative explanation of how the machine identifies the physical phase transitions, by recognizing certain properties of the configuration like the maximization of the specific heat, instead of associating directly the recognition procedure with the RG flow and its fixed points. Then from the reconstructed data we deduce the critical exponent associated to the magnetization to find satisfactory agreement with the actual physical value. We assume no prior knowledge about the criticality of the system and its Hamiltonian.},

For many physical inference problems, the full posterior distribution is unwieldy and seldom used in practice. Instead, we propose direct estimation of lower-dimensional marginal distributions, bypassing high-dimensional density estimation or high-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. By evaluating the two-dimensional marginal posteriors we can unveil the full-dimensional parameter covariance structure. We additionally propose constructing a simple hierarchy of fast neural regression models, called Moment Networks, that compute increasing moments of any desired lower-dimensional marginal posterior density; these reproduce exact results from analytic posteriors and those obtained from Masked Autoregressive Flows. We demonstrate marginal posterior density estimation using high-dimensional LIGO-like gravitational wave time series and describe applications for problems of fundamental cosmology.},

We analyze a DNN that has been found in previous work to accurately recover cosmological parameters in simulated maps of the WL convergence (κ). We derive constraints on the cosmological parameter pair (Ω_m,σ_8) from a combination of three commonly used WL statistics (power spectrum, lensing peaks, and Minkowski functionals), using ray-traced simulated κ maps. We show that the network can improve the inferred parameter constraints relative to this combination by 20% even in the presence of realistic levels of shape noise. We apply a series of well established saliency methods to interpret the DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme κ values. For noiseless maps, regions with negative κ account for 86-69% of the attribution of the DNN output, defined as the square of the saliency in input space. In the presence of shape nose, the attribution concentrates in high convergence regions, with 36-68% of the attribution in regions with κ > 3 σ_(κ).},

The GW signal waveforms are injected in public data from the O2 run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors, in time windows that do not coincide with those of known detected signals. We demonstrate that DL algorithms, trained with GW signal waveforms at distances of 2000 Mpc, still show high accuracy when detecting closer signals, within the ranges considered in our analysis. Moreover, by combining the results of the three-detector network in a unique RGB image, the single detector performance is improved by as much as 70%. Furthermore, we train a regression network to perform parameter inference on BBH spectrogram data and apply this network to the events from the the GWTC-1 and GWTC-2 catalogs. Without significant optimization of our algorithms we obtain results that are mostly consistent with published results by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration.

A three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict the mass of dark matter halos from the initial conditions.

Based on the electromagnetic resonance system for detecting such extra HFGWs, we adopt a new data processing scheme to identify the corresponding GW signal, which is the transverse perturbative photon fluxes (PPF). In order to overcome the problems of low efficiency and high interference in traditional data processing methods, we adopt deep learning to extract PPF and make some source parameters estimation. Deep learning is able to provide an effective method to realize classification and prediction tasks. Meanwhile, we also adopt anti-overfitting technique and make adjustment of some hyperparameters in the course of study, which improve the performance of classifier and predictor to a certain extent. Here the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to implement deep learning process concretely. In this case, we investigate the classification accuracy varying with the ratio between the number of positive and negative samples. When such ratio exceeds to 0.11, the accuracy could reach up to 100%. Besides, we also investigate the classification accuracy with different amplitude of extra HFGWs. As a predictor, the mean relative error of parameters estimation decreases when the amplitude of extra HFGWs increases. Especially, when amplitude h(t) is in 10−31-10−30 the mean relative error reaches around 0.014. On the contrary, the mean relative error increases with frequency increasing in 108-1011 Hz. At the optimal resonance frequency 5 × 109 Hz, the mean relative error is 0.12. Then we also study the mean relative error varying with waist radius W0 of Gaussian beam, its optimal value is 0.138 when W0 is in (0.05 m, 0.1 m) approximately. Compared with classifiers and predictors using other machine learning algorithms, deep CNN for our datasets has higher accuracy and lower error.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning algorithms are growing in popularity in the field of exoplanetary science due to their ability to model highly non-linear relations and solve interesting problems in a data-driven manner. Several works have attempted to perform fast retrievals of atmospheric parameters with the use of machine learning algorithms like deep neural networks (DNNs). Yet, despite their high predictive power, DNNs are also infamous for being 'black boxes'. It is their apparent lack of explainability that makes the astrophysics community reluctant to adopt them. What are their predictions based on? How confident should we be in them? When are they wrong and how wrong can they be? In this work, we present a number of general evaluation methodologies that can be applied to any trained model and answer questions like these. In particular, we train three different popular DNN architectures to retrieve atmospheric parameters from exoplanet spectra and show that all three achieve good predictive performance. We then present an extensive analysis of the predictions of DNNs, which can inform us - among other things - of the credibility limits for atmospheric parameters for a given instrument and model. Finally, we perform a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis to identify to which features of the spectrum the outcome of the retrieval is most sensitive. We conclude that for different molecules, the wavelength ranges to which the DNN's predictions are most sensitive, indeed coincide with their characteristic absorption regions. The methodologies presented in this work help to improve the evaluation of DNNs and to grant interpretability to their predictions.},

  abstract      = {The signal of continuous gravitational waves has a longer duration than the observation period. Even if the waveform in the source frame is monochromatic, we will observe the waveform with modulated frequencies due to the motion of the detector. If the source location is unknown, a lot of templates having different sky positions are required to demodulate the frequency and the required large computational cost restricts the applicable parameter region of coherent search. In this work, we propose and examine a new method to select candidates, which reduces the cost of coherent search by following-up only the selected candidates. As a first step, we consider a slightly idealized situation in which only a single-detector having 100% duty cycle is available and its detector noise is approximated by the stationary Gaussian noise. We combine several methods: 1) the short-time Fourier transform with the re-sampled data such that the Earth motion for the source is canceled in some reference direction, 2) the excess power search in the Fourier transform of the time series obtained by picking up the amplitude in a particular frequency bin from the short-time Fourier transform data, and 3) the deep learning method to further constrain the source sky position. We compare the computational cost and the minimum amplitude of the detectable signal with the coherent matched filtering analysis. With a reasonable computational cost, we find that our method can detect the signal having only 32% larger amplitude than that of the coherent search with 95% detection efficiency.},

We tested its robustness by injecting signals in the real noise data taken by the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network during the second observation run, O2. We trained a newly developed Mini-Inception Resnet neural network using time-frequency images corresponding to injections of simulated phenomenological signals, which mimic the waveforms obtained in 3D numerical simulations of CCSNe. With this algorithm we were able to identify signals from both our phenomenological template bank and from actual numerical 3D simulations of CCSNe. We computed the detection efficiency versus the source distance, obtaining that, for signal to noise ratio higher than 15, the detection efficiency is 70 % at a false alarm rate lower than 5%. We notice also that, in the case of O2 run, it would have been possible to detect signals emitted at 1 kpc of distance, whilst lowering down the efficiency to 60%, the event distance reaches values up to 14 kpc.},

Their raise was founded on market needs and engineering craftsmanship, the latter based more on trial and error than on theory. While still far behind the application forefront, the theoretical study of DNNs has recently made important advancements in analyzing the highly over-parameterized regime where some exact results have been obtained. Leveraging these ideas and adopting a more physics-like approach, here we construct a versatile field-theory formalism for supervised deep learning, involving renormalization group, Feynman diagrams and replicas. In particular we show that our approach leads to highly accurate predictions of learning curves of truly deep DNNs trained on polynomial regression tasks and that these predictions can be used for efficient hyper-parameter optimization. In addition, they explain how DNNs generalize well despite being highly over-parameterized, this due to an entropic bias to simple functions which, for the case of fully-connected DNNs with data sampled on the hypersphere, are low order polynomials in the input vector. Being a complex interacting system of artificial neurons, we believe that such tools and methodologies borrowed from condensed matter physics would prove essential for obtaining an accurate quantitative understanding of deep learning.},

Efforts are made to implement the currently proposed supervised machine learning models, such as ensembling techniques like Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Adaboost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), and Support Vector Regressor (SVR) to find out the best possible algorithm which can work over a variety of pulsars from the EPN database of pulsars. All the data used in this work is extracted from the European Pulsar Network (EPN) database of pulsar profiles. The training dataset is obtained by post-processing of pulsar profile data from the EPN database and testing is performed on a preselected portion of the original data. The results are obtained by testing the above algorithms for 10 different pulsars including some historically significant ones, and the predicted profiles are plotted. We find that Gradient boosting regressor works the best in denoising pulsar data. Through this work, we will try to emphasize that there is a reduction in the number of periods of folding by 35-40% when a combination of machine learning models with the existing pulsar folding techniques like Fast Folding Algorithm(FFA) is employed, which can further reduce the pulsar observation times for the telescopes hunting for pulsars today.},

  month         = dec,
  abstract      = {One of the key challenges of real-time detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers is the computational cost of conventional matched-filtering and Bayesian inference approaches. In particular, the application of these methods to the full signal parameter space available to the gravitational-wave detectors, and/or real-time parameter estimation is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, rapid detection and inference are critical for prompt follow-up of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying important transients, such as binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers. Training deep neural networks to identify specific signals and learn a computationally efficient representation of the mapping between gravitational-wave signals and their parameters allows both detection and inference to be done quickly and reliably, with high sensitivity and accuracy. In this work we apply a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify and characterize transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron-star mergers in real LIGO data. We show for the first time that artificial neural networks can promptly detect and characterize binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals in real LIGO data, and distinguish them from noise and signals from coalescing black-hole binaries. We demonstrate that our deep-learning framework recovers successfully all gravitational-wave events from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-1 [Phys. Rev. X 9 (2019), 031040]. These results emphasize the importance of using realistic gravitational-wave detector data in machine learning approaches, and represent a step towards achieving real-time detection and inference of gravitational waves.},

  abstract      = {The detection of gravitational waves is considered to be one of the most magnificent discoveries of the century. Due to the high computational cost of matched filtering pipeline, there is a hunt for an alternative powerful system. I present, for the first time, the use of 1D residual neural network for detection of gravitational waves. Residual networks have transformed many fields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with their robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we expect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected. However, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for classification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed number of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be detected, this turns out to be a drawback of deep learning. Shallow neural networks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good results with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network with detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I also discuss ways to reduce the time required to adapt to such changes in detection of gravitational waves for deep learning methods. Primarily, I aim to create a custom residual neural network for 1-dimensional time series inputs, which can learn a ton of features from dataset without giving up on increasing the number of classes or increasing the complexity of data. I use the two class of binary coalescence signals (Binary Black Hole Merger and Binary Neutron Star Merger signals) detected by LIGO to check the performance of residual structure on gravitational waves detection.},

Secondary anisotropies of the CMB will have an increased importance in forthcoming surveys, due both to the cosmological information they encode and the role they play in obscuring our view of the primary fluctuations. Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for reconstructing the fields that distort the primary CMB and produce secondary anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with current data, quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and other effects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable of the simultaneous reconstruction of two sources of secondary CMB anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We show that the ResUNet-CMB network significantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low noise levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy reionization reconstruction that would be present with a straightforward application of the quadratic estimator.},

  month         = jan,
  abstract      = {Low-latency gravitational wave search pipelines such as LLOID take advantage of low-rank factorization of the template matrix via singular value decomposition (SVD). With unprecedented improvements in detector bandwidth and sensitivity in advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors, one expects several orders of magnitude increase in the size of template banks. This poses a formidable computational challenge in factorizing extremely large matrices. Previously, [in Kulkarni et al. [6]], we introduced the idea of random projection (RP)-based matrix factorization as a computationally viable alternative to SVD, for such large template banks. In this follow-up paper, we demonstrate the application of a block-wise randomized matrix factorization (RMF) scheme using which one can compute the desired low-rank factorization corresponding to a fixed average SNR loss (hδh̊o/h̊oi). Unlike the SVD approach, this new scheme affords a much more efficient way of matrix factorization especially in the context of LLOID search pipelines. It is a well-known fact that for very large template banks, the total computational cost is dominated by the cost of reconstruction of the detection statistic and that the cost of filtering the data is insignificant in comparison. We are unaware of any previous work in literature that has tried to squarely address this issue of optimizing the reconstruction cost. We provide a possible solution to reduce the reconstruction cost using the matching pursuit(MP) algorithm. We show that it is possible to approximately reconstruct the time-series of the detection statistic at a fraction of the total cost using our MP algorithm. The combination of RMF along with MP can handle large template banks more efficiently in comparison to the direct application of SVD. Results from several numerical simulations have been presented to demonstrate their efficacy.},

We demonstrate how this technique can be used to improve the computational efficiency of gravitational wave searches from compact binaries of neutron stars or black holes. Improvements in low-frequency response and bandwidth due to detector hardware upgrades pose a data analysis challenge in the advanced LIGO era as they result in increased redundancy in template databases and longer templates due to the higher number of signal cycles in-band. The RP-based methods presented here address both these issues within the same broad framework. We first use RP for an efficient, singular value decomposition inspired template matrix factorization and develop a geometric intuition for why this approach works. We then use RP to calculate approximate time-domain match correlations in a lower dimensional vector space. For searches over parameters corresponding to non-spinning binaries with a neutron star and a black hole, a combination of the two methods can reduce the total on-line computational cost by an order of magnitude over a nominal baseline. This can, in turn, help free-up computational resources needed to go beyond current spin-aligned searches to more complex ones involving generically spinning waveforms.},

We introduce a deep learning architecture to push forward this problem for compact systems. While current machine learning algorithms in this area rely on scientist-derived instability metrics, our new technique learns its own metrics from scratch, enabled by a novel internal structure inspired from dynamics theory. Our Bayesian neural network model can accurately predict not only if, but also when a compact planetary system with three or more planets will go unstable. Our model, trained directly from short N-body time series of raw orbital elements, is more than two orders of magnitude more accurate at predicting instability times than analytical estimators, while also reducing the bias of existing machine learning algorithms by nearly a factor of three. Despite being trained on compact resonant and near-resonant three-planet configurations, the model demonstrates robust generalization to both non-resonant and higher multiplicity configurations, in the latter case outperforming models fit to that specific set of integrations. The model computes instability estimates up to five orders of magnitude faster than a numerical integrator, and unlike previous efforts provides confidence intervals on its predictions. Our inference model is publicly available in the SPOCK package, with training code open-sourced.},

  abstract      = {Instrumental and environmental transient noise bursts in gravitational-wave detectors, or glitches, may impair astrophysical observations by adversely affecting the sky localization and the parameter estimation of gravitational-wave signals. Denoising of detector data is especially relevant during low-latency operations because electromagnetic follow-up of candidate detections requires accurate, rapid sky localization and inference of astrophysical sources. NNETFIX is a machine learning-based algorithm designed to remove glitches detected in coincidence with transient gravitational-wave signals. NNETFIX uses artificial neural networks to estimate the portion of the data lost due to the presence of the glitch, which allows the recalculation of the sky localization of the astrophysical signal. The sky localization of the denoised data may be significantly more accurate than the sky localization obtained from the original data or by removing the portion of the data impacted by the glitch. We test NNETFIX in simulated scenarios of binary black hole coalescence signals and discuss the potential for its use in future low-latency LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA searches. In the majority of cases for signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, we find that the overlap of the sky maps obtained with the denoised data and the original data is better than the overlap of the sky maps obtained with the original data and the data with the glitch removed.},

Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8-10x finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40-80x fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations, and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black box machine learning approaches.

In addition to the joint analysis with these data, we simulate a catalog with standard siren events from binary neutron star mergers, within the sensitivity predicted by the Einstein Telescope, to reconstruct the dark sector coupling with more accuracy in a robust way. We find that the particular case, where w = -1 is fixed on the DE nature, has a statistical preference for an interaction in the dark sector at late times. In the general case, where w(z) is analyzed, we find no evidence for such dark coupling, and the predictions are compatible with the ΛCDM paradigm.

The targets, which are associated with TeV sources detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), are chosen to test for gravitational radiation from young, energetic pulsars with strong \mathrm{γ}{-}{}ray emission, and take maximum advantage of the frequency tracking capabilities of HMM compared to other CW search algorithms.

The 24 sub-bands searched in this study return 5,256 candidates above the Gaussian threshold with a false alarm probability of 1% per sub-band per target.
