  abstract = {The advent of experimental science facilities--instruments and observatories, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope --has brought about challenging, large-scale computational and data processing requirements. Traditionally, the computing infrastructure to support these facility’s requirements were organized into separate infrastructure that supported their high-throughput needs and those that supported their high-performance computing needs. We argue that to enable and accelerate scientific discovery at the scale and sophistication that is now needed, this separation between high-performance computing and high-throughput computing must be bridged and an integrated, unified infrastructure provided. In this paper, we discuss several case studies where such infrastructure has been implemented. These case studies span different science domains, software systems, and application requirements as well as levels of sustainability. A further aim of this paper is to provide a basis to determine the common characteristics and requirements of such infrastructure, as well as to begin a discussion of how best to support the computing requirements of existing and future experimental science facilities.},

Because of the expected low signal to noise ratio of LIGO data and incomplete knowledge of gravitational waveforms, evolutionary computing is an excellent candidate for LIGO data analysis studies. Using the evolutionary computing methods of genetic algorithms and genetic programming, we have developed, as a proof of principle, search algorithms that are effective at finding sine-gaussian signals hidden in noise while maintaining a small false alarm rate. Because we used realistic LIGO noise as a training ground, the algorithms we have evolved should be well suited to detecting signals in actual LIGO data, as well as in simulated noise. These algorithms have continuously improved during the five days of their evolution and are expected to improve further the more they are evolved. The top performing algorithms from generation 100 and 199 were benchmarked using gaussian white noise to illustrate their performance and the improvement over 100 generations.}

These auxiliary channels capture information about the state of the detector and its surroundings which can be used to infer potential terrestrial noise sources of some gravitational-wave-like events. We present an algorithm addressing the ordering (or equivalently optimizing) of such information from auxiliary systems in gravitational-wave detectors to establish veto conditions in searches for gravitational-wave transients. The procedure was used to identify vetoes for searches for unmodeled transients by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations during their science runs from 2005 through 2007. In this work we present the details of the algorithm; we also use a limited amount of data from LIGO's past runs in order to examine the method, compare it with other methods, and identify its potential to characterize the instruments themselves. We examine the dependence of receiver operating characteristic curves on the various parameters of the veto method and the implementation on real data. We find that the method robustly determines important auxiliary channels, ordering them by the apparent strength of their correlations to the gravitational-wave channel. This list can substantially reduce the background of noise events in the gravitational-wave data. In this way it can identify the source of glitches in the detector as well as assist in establishing confidence in the detection of gravitational-wave transients.}

These glitches increase the rate at which random coincidences occur, which reduces the significance of identified gravitational-wave events. The presence of these transients has precipitated extensive work to establish that observed gravitational wave events are astrophysical in nature. We discuss the response of the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from stellar mass binaries to various common glitches that were observed during advanced LIGO’s first and second observing runs. We show how these transients can mimic waveforms from compact binary coalescences and quantify the likelihood that a given class of glitches will create a trigger in the search pipeline. We explore the specific waveform parameters that are most similar to different glitch classes and demonstrate how knowledge of these similarities can be used when evaluating the significance of gravitational-wave candidates.}

As the advanced detectors are reaching sensitivity levels that allow for multiple detections of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources it is crucial to achieve a fast and accurate characterization of non-astrophysical transient noise shortly after it occurs in the detectors. Previously we presented three methods for the classification of transient noise sources. They are Principal Component Analysis for Transients (PCAT), Principal Component LALInference Burst (PC-LIB) and Wavelet Detection Filter with Machine Learning (WDF-ML). In this study we carry out the first performance tests of these algorithms on gravitational-wave data from the Advanced LIGO detectors. We use the data taken between the 3rd of June 2015 and the 14th of June 2015 during the 7th engineering run (ER7), and outline the improvements made to increase the performance and lower the latency of the algorithms on real data. This work provides an important test for understanding the performance of these methods on real, non stationary data in preparation for the second advanced gravitational-wave detector observation run, planned for later this year. We show that all methods can classify transients in non stationary data with a high level of accuracy and show the benefits of using multiple classifiers.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing run.}

  abstract = "The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser-interferometric detectors requires sensitivity to changes in distance much smaller than the diameter of atomic nuclei. Though sophisticated machinery and techniques have been developed over the past few decades to isolate such instruments from non-astrophysical noise, the detectors are still susceptible to instrumental and environmental noise transients known as “glitches,” which hinder searches for transient gravitational waves. The Gravity Spy project is an effort to comprehensively classify the glitches that afflict gravitational wave detectors into morphological families by combining the strengths of machine learning algorithms and citizen scientists. This paper presents the initial Gravity Spy dataset used for citizen scientist and machine learning classification – a static, accessible, documented dataset for testing machine learning supervised classification. Previous versions of this dataset used in [8, 53] did not include all current classes and also for some of the classes, some samples were pruned and added. This set consists of time–frequency images of LIGO glitches and their associated metadata. These glitches are organized by time–frequency morphology into 22 classes for which descriptions and representative images are presented. Results from the application of state-of-the-art supervised classification methods to this dataset are presented in order to provide baselines for future glitch classification work. Standard splitting for training, validation, and testing sets are also presented to facilitate the comparison between different machine learning methods. The baseline methods are selected from both traditional and more recent deep learning approaches. An ensemble framework is developed that demonstrates that combining various classifiers can yield a more accurate model for classification. The ensemble classifier, trained with the standard training set, achieves 98.21% accuracy on the standard test set."

	abstract = {The knowledge of the noise power spectral density of an
interferometric detector of gravitational waves is
fundamental for detection algorithms and for the analysis of
the data. In this paper we address both the problem of
identifying the noise power spectral density of
interferometric detectors by parametric techniques and the
problem of the whitening procedure of the sequence of data.
We will concentrate the study on a power spectral density
like that of the Italian-French detector VIRGO and we show
that with a reasonable number of parameters we succeed in
modelling a spectrum like the theoretical one of VIRGO,
reproducing all of its features.


We also
propose the use of adaptive techniques to identify and to
whiten the data of interferometric detectors on-line. We
analyse the behaviour of the adaptive techniques in the field
of stochastic gradient and in the least-squares filters. As a
result, we find that the least-squares lattice filter is the
best among those we have analysed. It succeeds
optimally in
following all the peaks of the noise power spectrum, and one
of its outputs is the whitened part of the spectrum. Besides,
the fast convergence of this algorithm, it lets us follow the
slow non-stationarity of the noise. These procedures could be
used to whiten the overall power spectrum or only some region
of it. The advantage of the techniques we propose is that they
do not require a priori knowledge of the noise power
spectrum to be analysed. Moreover, the adaptive techniques
let us identify and remove the spectral line, without
building any physical model of the source that produced
it.}

Understanding the statistical properties of noise is a complex endeavor, particularly in realistic detection scenarios. In this article we demonstrate that deep learning can handle the non-Gaussian and non-stationary nature of gravitational wave data, and showcase its application to denoise the gravitational wave signals generated by the binary black hole mergers GW150914, GW170104, GW170608 and GW170814 from advanced LIGO noise. To exhibit the accuracy of this methodology, we compute the overlap between the time-series signals produced by our denoising algorithm, and the numerical relativity templates that are expected to describe these gravitational wave sources, finding overlaps O≳0.99. We also show that our deep learning algorithm is capable of removing noise anomalies from numerical relativity signals that we inject in real advanced LIGO data. We discuss the implications of these results for the characterization of gravitational wave signals."

Various regression and interpolation techniques have been employed to build efficient waveform models, but no study has systematically compared the performance of these methods yet. Here we provide such a comparison. For analytical binary-black-hole waveforms, assuming either aligned or precessing spins, we compare the accuracy as well as the computational speed of a variety of regression methods, ranging from traditional interpolation to machine-learning techniques. We find that most methods are reasonably accurate, but efficiency considerations favour in many cases the simpler approaches. We conclude that sophisticated regression methods are not necessarily needed in standard gravitational-wave modeling applications, although machine-learning techniques might be more suitable for problems with higher complexity than what is tested here.}

To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time."

This deep learning method is an extension of the Deep Filtering method used by George and Huerta (2017) for multi-inputs of network detectors. Simulated coincident time series data sets in advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors are analyzed for estimating source luminosity distance and sky location. As a classifier, our deep neural network (DNN) can effectively recognize the presence of GW signals when the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of network detectors ≥ 9. As a predictor, it can also effectively estimate the corresponding source space parameters, including the luminosity distance D, right ascension α, and declination δ of the compact binary star mergers. When the SNR of the network detectors is greater than 8, their relative errors are all less than 23%. Our results demonstrate that Deep Filtering can process coincident GW time series inputs and perform effective classification and multiple space parameter estimation. Furthermore, we compare the results obtained from one, two, and three network detectors; these results reveal that a larger number of network detectors results in a better source location.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the detection of binary neutron stars gravitational wave based on convolutional neural network (CNN). To promote the detection performance and efficiency, we proposed a scheme based on wavelet packet (WP) decomposition and CNN. The WP decomposition is a time-frequency method and can enhance the discriminant features between gravitational wave signal and noise before detection. The CNN conducts the gravitational wave detection by learning a function mapping relation from the data under being processed to the space of detection results. This function-mapping-relation style detection scheme can detection efficiency significantly. In this work, instrument effects are considered, and the noise are computed from a power spectral density (PSD) equivalent to the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. The quantitative evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-art method matched filtering show the excellent performances for BNS gravitational wave detection. On efficiency, the current experiments show that this WP-CNN-based scheme is more than 960 times faster than the matched filtering.},

	title = {Identifying extra high frequency gravitational waves generated from oscillons with cuspy potentials using deep neural networks},
	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {During oscillations of cosmology inflation around the minimum of a cuspy potential after inflation, the existence of extra high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) (∼GHz) has been proven effectively recently. Based on the electromagnetic resonance system for detecting such extra HFGWs, we adopt a new data processing scheme to identify the corresponding GW signal, which is the transverse perturbative photon fluxes (PPF). In order to overcome the problems of low efficiency and high interference in traditional data processing methods, we adopt deep learning to extract PPF and make some source parameters estimation. Deep learning is able to provide an effective method to realize classification and prediction tasks. Meanwhile, we also adopt anti-overfitting technique and make adjustment of some hyperparameters in the course of study, which improve the performance of classifier and predictor to a certain extent. Here the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to implement deep learning process concretely. In this case, we investigate the classification accuracy varying with the ratio between the number of positive and negative samples. When such ratio exceeds to 0.11, the accuracy could reach up to 100%. Besides, we also investigate the classification accuracy with different amplitude of extra HFGWs. As a predictor, the mean relative error of parameters estimation decreases when the amplitude of extra HFGWs increases. Especially, when amplitude h(t) is in 10−31–10−30 the mean relative error reaches around 0.014. On the contrary, the mean relative error increases with frequency increasing in 108–1011 Hz. At the optimal resonance frequency 5 × 109 Hz, the mean relative error is 0.12. Then we also study the mean relative error varying with waist radius W
0 of Gaussian beam, its optimal value is 0.138 when W
0 is in (0.05 m, 0.1 m) approximately. Compared with classifiers and predictors using other machine learning algorithms, deep CNN for our datasets has higher accuracy and lower error.}

Two successive steps of the proposed scheme are as following: first, decompose the data using a wavelet packet and represent the GW signal and noise using the derived decomposition coefficients; Second, detect the existence of GW using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reflect our special attention on searching GW signals, the performance is evaluated using not only the traditional classification accuracy (correct ratio), but also receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and experiments show excelllent performances on both evaluation measures. The generalization of a proposed searching scheme on GW model parameter and possible extensions to other data analysis tasks are crucial for a machine learning based approach. On this aspect, experiments shows that there is no significant difference between GW model parameters on identification performances by our proposed scheme. Therefore, the proposed scheme has excellent generalization and could be used to search for non-trained and un-known GW signals or glitches in the future GW astronomy era.},

  abstract = "The groundbreaking discoveries of gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers [1], [2], [3] and, most recently, coalescing neutron stars [4] started a new era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and revolutionized our understanding of the Cosmos. Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are already transforming many technological fields and have also proven successful in gravitational-wave astrophysics for detection and characterization of gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes [5], [6], [7]. Here we use a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers in noisy time series representative of typical gravitational-wave detector data. Specifically, we show that a deep convolution neural network trained on 100,000 data samples can promptly identify binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals and distinguish them from noise and signals from merging black hole binaries. These results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for real-time detection of gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers, which is critical for a prompt follow-up and detailed observation of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying these important transients."

The multi-dimensional samples consisting of data corresponding to the statistical and physical quantities from the coherent search pipeline are fed into the artificial neural network to distinguish simulated gravitational-wave signals from background noise artifacts. Our result shows that the data classification efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability (FAP) is improved by the artificial neural network in comparison to the conventional detection statistic. Specifically, the distance at 50% detection probability at a fixed false positive rate is increased about 8%–14% for the considered waveform models. We also evaluate a few seconds of the gravitational-wave data segment using the trained networks and obtain the FAP. We suggest that the artificial neural network can be a complementary method to the conventional detection statistic for identifying gravitational-wave signals related to the short GRBs.}

In order to efficiently detect and analyze them, advanced and automatic signal processing and machine learning techniques could help to support standard tools and techniques. Another challenge relates to the large volume of data collected by the detectors on a daily basis, which creates a gap between the amount of data generated and effectively analyzed. In this paper, we propose two approaches involving deep auto-encoder models to analyze time series collected from Gravitational Waves detectors and provide a classification label (noise or real signal). The purpose is to discard noisy time series accurately and identify time series that potentially contain a real phenomenon. Experiments carried out on three datasets show that the proposed approaches implemented using the Apache Spark framework, represent a valuable machine learning tool for astrophysical analysis, offering competitive accuracy and scalability performances with respect to state-of-the-art methods.},

Particularly, our approach is intended for near- and real-time analyses, which are essential for effective follow-up of detections.

  abstract  = {Gravitational waves are now observed routinely. Therefore, data analysis has to keep up with ever improving detectors. One relatively new tool to search for gravitational wave signals in detector data are machine learning algorithms that utilize deep neuralnnetworks. The first successful application was able to differentiate time series strain data that contains a gravitational wave from a binary black hole merger from data that consists purely of noise. This work expands the analysis to signals from binary neutron star mergers, where a rapid detection is most valuable, as electromagnetic counterparts might otherwise be missed or not observed for long enough. We showcase many different architecture, discuss what choices improved the sensitivity of our search and introduce a new multi-rate approach. We find that the final algorithm gives state of the art performance in comparison to other search pipelines that use deep neural networks. On the other hand we also conclude that our analysis is not yet able to achieve sensitivities that are on par with template based searches. We report our results at false alarm rates down to ~30 samples/month which has not been tested by other neural network algorithms. We hope to provide information about useful architectural choices and improve our algorithm in the future to achieve sensitivities and false alarm rates that rival matched filtering based approaches on.},

The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present LIGO/Virgo, and future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.}

abstract = { In this paper, we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the mass ratio q in a binary black hole collision out of the gravitational wave (GW) strain. We assume the strain is a time series (TS) that contains a part of the orbital phase and the ring-down of the final black hole. We apply the method to the strain itself in the time domain and also in the frequency domain. We present the accuracy in the prediction of the ANNs trained with various values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The core of our results is that the estimate of the mass ratio is obtained with a small sample of training signals and resulting in predictions with errors of the order of 1\% for our best ANN configurations. }

  abstract = {We present an algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), that estimates the mass ratio in a binary black hole collision out of given gravitational wave (GW) strains. In this analysis, the ANN is trained with a sample of GW signals generated with numerical simulations. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated with GWs generated also with simulations for given mass ratios unknown to the ANN. We measure the accuracy of the algorithm in the interpolation and extrapolation regimes. We present the results for noise free signals and signals contaminated with Gaussian noise, in order to foresee the dependence of the method accuracy in terms of the signal to noise ratio.},

	abstract = {We present the first estimation of the mass and spin magnitude of Kerr black holes resulting from the coalescence of binary black holes using a deep neural network. The network is trained on a dataset containing 80% of the full publicly available catalog of numerical simulations of gravitational waves emission by binary black hole systems, including full precession effects for spinning binaries. The network predicts the remnant black holes mass and spin with an error less than 0.04% and 0.3% respectively for 90% of the values in the non-precessing test dataset, it is 0.1% and 0.3% respectively in the precessing test dataset. When compared to existing fits in the LIGO algorithm software library, the network enables to reduce the remnant mass root mean square error to one half in the non-precessing case. In the precessing case, both remnant mass and spin mean square errors are decreased to one half, and the network corrects the bias observed in available fits.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The quest to observe gravitational waves challenges our ability to discriminate signals from detector noise. This issue is especially relevant for transient gravitational waves searches with a robust eyes wide open approach, the so called all-sky burst searches. Here we show how signal classification methods inspired by broad astrophysical characteristics can be implemented in all-sky burst searches preserving their generality. In our case study, we apply a multivariate analyses based on artificial neural networks to classify waves emitted in compact binary coalescences. We enhance by orders of magnitude the significance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the noise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of noise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We also show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be performed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in discriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future observations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing recoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of the flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient gravitational waves.}

	abstract = {We present results on the mass, spin, and redshift distributions with phenomenological population models using the 10 binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected in the first and second observing runs completed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We constrain properties of the BBH mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive BH in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1% of BHs more massive than 45  and a power-law index of α =  (90% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of BHs with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modeling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or increasing with redshift with 93% probability. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R =  Gpc−3 yr−1 (90% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of BHs via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of BHs across cosmic time.}

The development of fast and robust data analysis methods is crucial to increase the chances of a detection. We have developed a new and flexible general data analysis framework for the search of this kind of signals, which allows to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by about two orders of magnitude with respect to current procedures. This can correspond, at fixed computing cost, to a sensitivity gain of up to 10%–20%, depending on the search parameter space. Some possible applications are discussed, with a particular focus on a directed search for sources in the Galactic center. Validation through the injection of artificial signals in the data of Advanced LIGO first observational science run is also shown.}

	abstract = {Among the astrophysical sources in the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Advanced Virgo detectors’ frequency band are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational waves. Searches for these continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long stretches of data in a matched-filter framework e.g. the -statistic method. In an all-sky search for a priori unknown sources, a large number of templates are matched against the data using a pre-defined grid of variables (the gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates), subsequently producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the grid points at which the signal reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is encoded in the multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first work of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the distributions. We consider three basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency detector artifact (‘stationary line’), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and 2D versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained and tested on a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these implementations correctly classify the instances of data at various signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing concept generalization i.e. satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies. In addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and possible applications of these implementations.}

	abstract = {A central challenge in gravitational wave astronomy is identifying weak signals in the presence of non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. The separation of gravitational wave signals from noise requires good models for both. When accurate signal models are available, such as for binary Neutron star systems, it is possible to make robust detection statements even when the noise is poorly understood. In contrast, searches for ‘un-modeled’ transient signals are strongly impacted by the methods used to characterize the noise. Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet–Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model.}

To test the accuracies of our 1D and 2D CNN classification, we add CCSN waveforms from the most recent hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven core-collapse to simulated Gaussian colored noise with the Virgo interferometer and the planned Einstein Telescope sensitivity curve. We find classification accuracies, for a single detector, of over ∼ 95 % for both 1D and 2D CNN pipelines. For the first time in machine learning CCSN studies, we add short duration detector noise transients to our data to test the robustness of our method against false alarms created by detector noise artifacts. Further to this, we show that the CNN can distinguish between different types of CCSN waveform models.}

Searches for gravitational-wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherent WaveBurst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors.}

Pioneering efforts on this front include citizen science campaigns adopted by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). SDSS datasets have been recently used to train neural network models to classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that overlap the footprint of both surveys. Herein, we demonstrate that knowledge from deep learning algorithms, pre-trained with real-object images, can be transferred to classify galaxies that overlap both SDSS and DES surveys, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy ≳99.6%. We demonstrate that this process can be completed within just eight minutes using distributed training. While this represents a significant step towards the classification of DES galaxies that overlap previous surveys, we need to initiate the characterization of unlabelled DES galaxies in new regions of parameter space. To accelerate this program, we use our neural network classifier to label over ten thousand unlabelled DES galaxies, which do not overlap previous surveys. Furthermore, we use our neural network model as a feature extractor for unsupervised clustering and find that unlabelled DES images can be grouped together in two distinct galaxy classes based on their morphology, which provides a heuristic check that the learning is successfully transferred to the classification of unlabelled DES images. We conclude by showing that these newly labelled datasets can be combined with unsupervised recursive training to create large-scale DES galaxy catalogs in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era."

  abstract      = {We present the results of a proof-of-concept experiment that demonstrates that deep learning can successfully be used for production-scale classification of compact star clusters detected in Hubble Space Telescope(HST) ultraviolet-optical imaging of nearby spiral galaxies (D≲ 20  \textrm{Mpc}{}{)} in the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-HST survey. Given the relatively small nature of existing, human-labelled star cluster samples, we transfer the knowledge of state-of-the-art neural network models for real-object recognition to classify star clusters candidates into four morphological classes. We perform a series of experiments to determine the dependence of classification performance on neural network architecture (ResNet18 and VGG19-BN), training data sets curated by either a single expert or three astronomers, and the size of the images used for training. We find that the overall classification accuracies are not significantly affected by these choices. The networks are used to classify star cluster candidates in the PHANGS-HST galaxy NGC 1559, which was not included in the training samples. The resulting prediction accuracies are 70 per cent, 40 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 50-70 per cent for class 1, 2, 3 star clusters, and class 4 non-clusters, respectively. This performance is competitive with consistency achieved in previously published human and automated quantitative classification of star cluster candidate samples (70-80 per cent, 40-50 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 60-70 per cent). The methods introduced herein lay the foundations to automate classification for star clusters at scale, and exhibit the need to prepare a standardized data set of human-labelled star cluster classifications, agreed upon by a full range of experts in the field, to further improve the performance of the networks introduced in this study.},

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter halos. Deep-learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate weakly interacting massive particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids. This is crucial in future efforts to identify the true nature of dark matter. We implement, for the first time, a classification approach to identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure. Utilizing convolutional neural networks trained on sets of simulated images, we demonstrate the feasibility of deep neural networks to reliably distinguish among different types of dark matter substructure. With thousands of strong lensing images anticipated with the coming launch of Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we expect that supervised and unsupervised deep-learning models will play a crucial role in determining the nature of dark matter.}

  abstract      = {Low mass X-ray binaries are prime targets for continuous gravitational wave searches by ground-based interferometers. Results are presented from a search for five low-mass X-ray binaries whose spin frequencies and orbital elements are measured accurately from X-ray pulsations: HETE J1900.1-2455, IGR J00291+5934, SAX J1808.4-3658, XTE J0929-314, and XTE J1814-338. Data are analysed from Observing Run 2 of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The search algorithm uses a hidden Markov model to track spin wandering, the 𝓙-statistic maximum likelihood matched filter to track orbital phase, and a suite of five vetoes to reject artefacts from non-Gaussian noise. The search yields a number of low-significance, above threshold candidates consistent with the selected false-alarm probability. The candidates will be followed up in subsequent observing runs.},
